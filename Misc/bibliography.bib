abstract = {A survey of the instabilities of switching voltage regulators with different types of current-mode controllers (including LC**3 or constant-hysteresis; MC**2 or constant-frequency and constant off-time versions) is presented. Apart from open-loop oscillation of the constant frequency regulator above 50{\%} duty ratio, other instabilities can also arise by increasing the ac loop gain. At the constant-hysteresis controller the operating frequency changes; at the other types continuously or hysteretically arising subharmonic oscillation appears. These phenomena can be analyzed by taking into account the effect of the amplified and fed-back ripple voltage to the operation of the current comparator. Calculations were made to establish maximum usable ac gains for the three basic power converter topologies (buck, boost and buck-boost) and for the above mentioned controllers. Experiments were carried out for several power circuit and controller combinations.},

abstract = {The main focus of this paper is the implementation of mixed-signal peak current mode control in low-power dc-dc converters for portable applications. A DAC is used to link the digital voltage loop compensator to the analog peak current mode loop. Conventional DAC architectures, such as flash or {\&}x0394;{\&}x03A3; are not suitable due to excessive power consumption and limited bandwidth of the reconstruction filter, respectively. The charge-pump based DAC (CP-DAC) used in this work has relatively poor linearity compared to more expensive DAC topologies; however, this can be tolerated since the linearity has a minor effect on the converter dynamics as long as the limit-cycle conditions are met. The CP-DAC has a guaranteed monotonic behavior from the digital current command to the peak inductor current, which is essential for maintaining stability. A buck converter IC, which was fabricated in a 0.18 {\&}x03BC;m CMOS process with 5 V compatible transistors, achieves a response time of 4 {\&}x03BC;s at fs=3 MHz and Vout=1 V, for a 200 mA load-step. The active area of the controller is only 0.077 mm2, and the total controller current-draw, which is heavily dominated by the on-chip senseFET current-sensor, is below 250 {\&}x03BC;A for a load current of Iout=50 mA.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a digitally-controlled buck converter with adaptive core biasing that allows for minimization of the output capacitor as well as of the inductor core. The improved performances are obtained through adaptive relocation of the converter operating point on the B-H curve of the inductor core, with the help of a digitally controlled low-power biasing circuit and an extra inductor winding. During transients, the point is set in the saturation region, so the inductance is drastically reduced. As a result the inductor current slew rate and, consequently, load transient response are improved allowing output capacitor reduction. The biasing is also used to reduce flux density allowing the core volume minimization. Experimental verifications with a 3.3 V, 30 W, 500 kHz prototype show that the adaptive biasing system has about two times smaller voltage deviation than the conventional buck allowing for proportional reduction in the output capacitance and for about 40{\%} reduction in the magnetic core size. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

@article{Huang2018,
abstract = {Nonlinearities have been the major obstructions that limit the computational efficiency in power electronic circuit simulation for a long time. Yet there is no standard way for dealing with them. This paper presents a new method that makes the handling of nonlinearities fast and stable. In the proposed method, nonlinearities are transformed into a uniform representation---a constant resistor in parallel with a companion current source, thus making the system admittance matrix constant for fixed time-step simulation. To solve for the corresponding companion current source, nonlinearities are treated as either current or voltage sources and a diagonal time-varying matrix equation is developed. Three methods are proposed for solving the matrix equation---pre-computed inversion or factorization, modified Gaussian elimination, and updating inverse using the Sherman-Morrison formula---that can fit different system sizes and applications. The proposed method is validated by two common power electronic converter topologies, both in off-line and real-time simulation. Off-line tests show that the proposed method achieved the same accuracy with the mature simulation software while being more than 10 times faster. The same test cases are also implemented into field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) based real-time simulation experiments for verification. IEEE},

The proposed charge balance method is implemented with analog components and is cheaper and more effective than its digital counterparts since complex arithmetic and sampling delay is eliminated. The proposed controller will consistently cause the buck converter to recover from an arbitrary load transient with the smallest possible voltage deviation in the shortest possible settling time. Since the controller is nonlinear during transient conditions, it is not limited by bandwidth/switching frequency. Unlike conventional linear controllers, the dynamic response (voltage deviation, settling time) of the proposed controller can be estimated using a set of equations. This greatly simplifies the design process of the output filter. Simulation and experimental results show the functionality of the controller and demonstrate the superior dynamic response over that of a conventional linear controller.},

abstract = {Differential power processing (DPP) is a power electronics system architecture that configures DC-DC converters in parallel with the PV string to improve its power yield. The parallel nature of the DPP architecture brings a number of benefits such as low converter power rating and low power losses, all of which make DPP especially suitable for sub-module level maximum power point tracking (MPPT). Meanwhile, micro-inverters typically perform only module level MPPT and do not address power losses due to uncompensated sub-module mis-match. In this paper, we introduce DPP converters into a micro-inverter system to improve its energy capture by recovering power losses due to sub-module mismatch. We present a small-footprint DPP converter design together with a control scheme such that the DPP converters can work with commercial micro-inverters and can be seamlessly integrated into the existing micro-inverter design. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution, a hardware prototype was built and tested with an off-the-shelf commercial micro-inverter to prove the concept. The improvement in energy capture with DPP converters was experimentally verified. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to present control characteristics of digital peak current mode dc-dc converter. It is difficult to implement the digital current control. An expensive A-D converter is required in order to sample a current. Furthermore, even if an A-D converter can sample the current, it is also needed the high-performance processor to process the sampling data. The peak current can be detected by using an inexpensive voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) and a programmable delay circuit in the proposed method. In this paper, control characteristics of the proposed method are described by analytic expression. Also, we confirm that the stable region of the system of the dc-dc converter used by the proposed method is expanded than the conventional voltage mode by using the simulation.},

abstract = {During the last few decades power converter-based systems have become a very interesting solution for electric power distribution in many applications. They have been successfully implemented in ships and "more electric aircrafts", replacing some of the mechanical and hydraulic systems for power converters in order to optimize the efficiency and reliability of the vehicles. They have been also applied to UPS (Uninterruptible Power Systems) for applications where the efficiency or the security of supply is mandatory as in hospitals and data centers. More recently, these architectures have been proposed for Smart Grids. An important advantage of using power converters is the possibility of dynamical independence between different parts of the system. Therefore these different parts can be studied individually, drastically simplifying the analysis of large systems. However, the analysis of these parts is not straightforward, since the interconnection of power converters produces interaction between them, which can lead to dynamical degradation or even instability. This analysis is often performed by system designers, who usually do not have information about the internal architecture of the converters. Besides, the power converters behavior is operating point dependent, so in many cases small-signal techniques are not enough for these applications. Therefore, in order to cope with these issues, this paper proposes a blackbox large signal stability analysis based on the Lyapunov method. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

abstract = {Differential power processing (DPP) is a power electronics system architecture that configures DC-DC converters in parallel with the PV string to improve its power yield. The parallel nature of the DPP architecture brings a number of benefits such as low converter power rating and low power losses, all of which make DPP especially suitable for sub-module level maximum power point tracking (MPPT). Meanwhile, micro-inverters typically perform only module level MPPT and do not address power losses due to uncompensated sub-module mis-match. In this paper, we introduce DPP converters into a micro-inverter system to improve its energy capture by recovering power losses due to sub-module mismatch. We present a small-footprint DPP converter design together with a control scheme such that the DPP converters can work with commercial micro-inverters and can be seamlessly integrated into the existing micro-inverter design. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution, a hardware prototype was built and tested with an off-the-shelf commercial micro-inverter to prove the concept. The improvement in energy capture with DPP converters was experimentally verified. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {Immediate (acute) neuronal damage in response to overstimulation of glutamate receptors results from toxic exposure to food poisons acting as glutamate analogues. Glutamate agonist application evokes dramatic intrinsic optical signals (IOSs) in the rat hippocampal slice preparation, particularly in the CA1 region. Theoretically IOSs are generated by alterations to neuronal and glial structure that change light transmittance (LT) in live brain tissue. To better understand such signals, IOSs evoked by the glutamate agonist N-methyl-D-aspartate were imaged in the rat hippocampal slice. We correlated these excitotoxic signals with: (1) biophysical principles governing light transport, (2) tissue volume changes as measured using a free intracellular fluorophore (calcein), (3) dendritic morphology visualized by dye injection, and (4) standard histopathology. In theory LT elevation evoked during acute excitotoxic swelling is generated by change to subcellular structure that reduces light scattering during cell swelling. However, in responsive dendritic regions, initial LT elevation caused by cell swelling was overridden by the formation of dendritic beads, a conformation that increased light scattering (thereby reducing LT) even as the calcein signal demonstrated that the tissue continued to swell. Thus IOS imaging reveals acute somatic and dendritic damage during excitotoxic stress that can be monitored across slices of brain tissue in real time.},

The discrete-time model of the converter is presented as the fundamental to digital controller design and followed by the digital controller design. Moreover, the effect of predictive PCM control with leading edge modulation on limit cycle is analyzed.

components of the converters are designed and optimized as planar
structures with custom-shaped ferrite cores. The ZVS-QSW buck converter
is predicted to achieve the highest efficiency under the area and height
constraints. A prototype 1-MHz ZVS-QSW buck converter with a PCB area of
79.6 mm(2) and component height of 1 mm, designed for an input voltage
range of 5 V - 20 V, an output voltage range of 3 V - 4.2 V, and a
maximum output current of 10 A is built and tested. The prototype
converter achieves a peak efficiency of 96.7{\%} and a power density of
3230 W/in(3).},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {A linear/nonlinear digital controller is presented that allows a Buck converter to recover from a load transient event with near-optimal voltage deviation and recovery time. A novel digital double accumulator calculation block is used to calculate the appropriate pulse width modulation switching time instants. The proposed controller possesses many advantages not demonstrated by a single controller in the previous literature. For example, unlike many previously proposed time-optimal digital controllers, the proposed controller provides an excellent transient response as it is capable of reacting asynchronously to a load transient event. In addition, it is demonstrated that the proposed controller can operate without requiring information pertaining to the Buck converters output inductor. Furthermore, the proposed controller can be extended to applications that require load-line regulation. Lastly, unlike all previous digital time-optimal controllers, the proposed controller does not require digital multiplier or divider blocks nor does it require 2-D lookup tables. Thus, the controller can be implemented through the use of low-cost field programmable gate arrays or complex programmable logic devices. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {In this paper, a new sensorless control strategy based on the square-waveform high-frequency pulsating voltage signal injection into the stationary reference frame is proposed. Similar to the sinusoidal-waveform injection method, by injecting the high-frequency square-waveform pulsating voltage carrier voltage into the $\alpha$- (or $\beta$-) axis of the stationary reference frame, the response carrier current will fluctuate with the position-dependent saliency, and then the rotor position information can be retrieved without any filtering. Furthermore, with higher frequency, the bandwidth of the position estimation can be significantly improved compared with all the sinusoidal-waveform injection strategies, and the influence of the winding resistance can also be fully eliminated. Meanwhile, the proposed new strategy injects a pulsating high-frequency carrier voltage into the stator stationary reference frame as stable as the rotating carrier signal injection method. Then, the rotor position information can be retrieved from the carrier current response, which is amplitude modulated by the machine saliency as simple as the pulsating carrier signal injection method. The experimental results validate that this strategy can achieve accurate rotor position estimation with good steady-state and dynamic performances by considering the cross-saturation effect even when there exhibits some noise in the estimated rotor position.},

abstract = {These days, variable frequency current mode controls are widely used in voltage regulators (VRs) for their higher light load efficiency, better small signal property and better transient response than fixed frequency current mode controls. One major issue for variable frequency control is its large switching frequency (fsw) variation with duty cycle. This variable fSW creates unpredictable noise in the system which is difficult to filter out, and hence not preferred by many frequency sensitive applications like mobile applications. While using variable frequency control e.g. constant on-time control (COT) in these applications, people use ‘Adaptive COT' control which slowly changes the TON with duty cycle at steady state operation to keep the steady state frequency constant. VIN/VREF Feed-forward method and ‘Phase Locked Loop (PLL)' method are very widely used to realize Adaptive COT control in the industry. Normally, VIN/VREF feed-forward method is very simple and fast but naturally suffers inaccuracy issue for its feed-forward approach; while PLL method is very accurate but suffers from complicated additional loop adjustment. Therefore, this paper proposes a new accurate but simple frequency control loop for variable frequency controls. This paper also proposes two additional techniques for performance improvements in proposed method, namely, faster loop settling time by using feed-forward signal and better loop stability with duty cycle variation by adding adaptive loop gain control},

abstract = {In the presented DA (distributed amplifier) architecture, a feedback mechanism that aims at improving the gain with a minimum reduction in BW is proposed. It is seen that in the band where the distributed effect of the DA is in action, the ratio of the forward to reverse gain is substantial (and depends on the number of stages used). The input and output blocks are connected to this core stage to provide matching and stability This method is different from other techniques that improve gain (e.g., cascade of DAs or matrix amplifier) in that it uses a new internal feedback to fed signals go through one DA twice. The input, core and output DA blocks consist of 4/3/3 gain elements respectively except that the core DA uses series input capacitances at the gates for BW enhancement and biasing purposes. Terminations Zx and Zy are chosen to minimize undesired reflections. The input and output biases are fed through appropriate bias tees. The lower cutoff of the DA is set at 12 GHz for our application in a wideband mm-wave imaging module. This frequency could be extended to frequencies close to 1 GHz if appropriate AC-coupling capacitors are used.},

One is a 110 MHz, 23 W converter which uses a high performance rf LDMOSFET. The converter achieves higher than 87{\%} efficiency at nominal input and output voltages, and maintains good efficiency down to 5{\%} of full load. The second implementation, aimed towards integration, is a 50 MHz 17 W converter which uses a transistor from a 50 V integrated power process. In addition, two resonant gate drive schemes suitable for VHF operation are presented, both of which provide rapid startup and low-loss operation. Both converters regulate the output using high-bandwidth on-off hysteretic control, which enables fast transient response and efficient light-load operation. The low energy storage requirements of the converters allow the use of coreless inductors in both designs, thereby eliminating magnetic core loss and introducing the possibility of easy integration.},

Condition monitoring and fault-tolerant control have been identified as a means of improving the reliability and availability of offshore or inaccessible renewable energy devices. As a result, two different ways of connecting modular generator stages are presented. Based on the above topologies two wind turbine models are designed in MATLAB{\textregistered}/Simulink {\textregistered} and fault-tolerance is investigated by implementing single electrical faults in one of the stages, such as single phase open circuit, diode short circuit, two phase short circuit and diode open circuit. It was found that the first topology offers fault-tolerance against the single phase open circuit fault while the second offers isolation between generator stages in all types of faults. Finally, the signal processing techniques of alpha-beta current locus, Power Spectral Density analysis and Continuous Wavelet Transformation have been implemented in order to extract detectable patterns of the electrical faults. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

This newly developed system where inverter modules are connected in back to back is addressed as Interline-PV (I-PV) system. Based on the inverter reconfiguration, three distinct topologies can be realized, namely, (i) Shunt I-PV, (ii) Series I-PV and (iii) Shunt-Series I-PV.

The proposed configurations of PV system can act as Inter Line Power Flow controller (IPFC), Static Synchronous Compensator (STATCOM), or Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC). The new configurations expand the role of PV plant to regulate the network/feeder voltages, support active and reactive powers and enhance the overall dynamic performance of both the feeders. This paper discusses the advantages and limitations of each of the I-PV systems. A simulation study is done to illustrate some of the benefits offered by I-PV systems.},

abstract = {As the performance of digital signal processors has increased rapidly during the last decade, there is a growing interest to replace the analog controllers in low power switching converters by more complicated and flexible digital control algorithms. Compared to high power converters, the control loop bandwidths for converters in the lower power range are generally much higher. Because of this, the dynamic properties of the uniformly-sampled pulse-width modulators used in low power applications become an important restriction to the maximum achievable bandwidth of control loops. Though frequency- and Laplace-domain models for uniformly-sampled pulse-width modulators are very valuable as they improve the general perception of the dynamic behavior of these modulators, the direct discrete design of the digital compensator requires a z-domain model for the combination modulator and converter For this purpose a new exact small-signal z-domain model is derived. In accordance with the zero-order-hold equivalent commonly used for 'regular' digital control systems, this z-domain model gives rise to the development of a uniformly-sampled pulse-width-modulator equivalent of the converter. This z-domain model is characterized by its capability to quantify the different dynamics of the converter for different modulators, its ease of use and its ability to predict the values of the control variables at the true sampling instants of the real system.},

abstract = {By reducing the power supply voltage, faster, lower power consumption, and high integration density data processing systems can be achieved. The current generation high-speed complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) processors (e.g., Alpha, Pentium, Power PC) are operating at above 300 MHz with 2.5 to 3.3 V output range. Future processors will be designed in the 1.1-1.8 V range, to further enhance their speed-power performance. These new generation microprocessors will present very dynamic loads with high current slew rates during transient. As a result, they will require a special power supply, voltage regulator module (VRM), to provide well-regulated voltage. The VRMs should have high power densities, high efficiencies, and good transient performance. In this paper, the critical technical issues to achieve this target for future generation microprocessors are addressed. A VRM candidate topology, interleaved quasisquare-wave (QSW), is proposed. The design, simulation and experimental results are presented},

The factors that affect the overall efficiency in a parallel connected converter and the calculation of the parameters that determine the effectiveness of the ripple cancellation are reported. A prototype parallel converter is designed based on the proposed converter design technique and the current ripple seen by the output capacitor is successfully reduced by 66{\%} with the proposed ripple cancellation technique, under different line and load conditions.},

abstract = {We propose nanoelectromechanical (NEM) switches that operate via electromechanical modulation of tunneling current through several-nanometer-thick switching gaps. In such a device, direct contact between electrodes is avoided by utilizing self-assembled molecular layers to define the switching gap. Electrostatic compression of the molecular layer reduces the tunneling gap leading to an exponential increase in the tunneling current, turning on the switch. With removal of an applied voltage, the compressed layer provides the elastic restoring force necessary to overcome the surface adhesive forces, turning off the switch. Thus, the proposed tunneling NEM switch may enable low-voltage operation while simultaneously mitigating device failure due to stiction. This principle is experimentally investigated using a prototype two-terminal tunneling NEM switch with a switching gap formed by a fluorinated decanethiol layer. In this device, the presence of the molecular film promotes repeatable switching. A comparison of the switch operation with a theoretical model indicates electrostatic compression of the molecular switching gap.},

The ideal stationary charging system requires no input from the user, and places as few restrictions on either parking location, or environmental conditions (i.e. rain or snow) as possible. The success of inductive charging systems is contingent largely on the design of the magnetic coupling components; i.e. the track pad and the pickup. This paper details a new topology for the track pad, consisting of two largely coplanar, partially overlapping coils positioned such that there is no mutual inductance between them. This arrangement prevents interaction of the two coils, and allows the currents within them to be independent in both phase and magnitude. By controlling the phase and magnitude of the two coil currents, the magnetic field can be shaped to assist in power transfer to a pickup underneath an EV.},

In such a process, the two-stage architecture presented offers high efficiency, high power density, and high- bandwidth regulation. We show that by merging the switched-capacitor stage and the regulation stage in a specific manner, further performance improvements can be attained. When the fast-switching regulation stage is used to provide soft charging of the switched-capacitor stage, a substantial improvement in performance is possible.

abstract = {A switching control strategy to control the power flow and minimize the total power losses of the dual active bridge converter topology is proposed in this paper. The control strategy consists of driving the bridge with the largest DC voltage to generate a three-level pulsewidth-modulated (PWM) voltage waveform. This PWM is ruled by two manipulated variables: the phase shift between the primary and secondary transformer voltages and the modulation index. These variables are calculated using an algorithm that is deduced on the basis of particular calculation and analysis of converter losses, which are also presented in this paper. An experimental prototype was implemented to validate the theoretical analysis and feasibility of the proposal. The experimental results revealed that the overall efficiency of this converter can be improved up to 10{\%} using the control strategy instead of the conventional one.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new system configuration for a large-scale Photovoltaic (PV) power system with multi-line transmission/distribution networks. A PV power plant is reconfigured in a way that two adjacent power system networks/ feeders can be interconnected. The inverter modules in a PV power plant are configured such that the system is represented as a back to back inverter connected multi-line system, called as Interline-PV (I-PV) system. The proposed I-PV system then can be controlled adequately allowing the PV solar plant to function as a flexible AC transmission system (FACTS) device, such as, interline power flow controller (IPFC). With the proposed I-PV system both active and reactive power flow control and energy management in a multi-line system can be achieved. The I-PV system can have various applications, for example, to regulate the feeder voltages, load reactive power support, real power transfer from over power generation line to under loaded line, improve the overall system performance against dynamic disturbances (such as, power system damping) and so on. A simulation study is carried out to illustrate one of the capabilities and effectiveness of the proposed I-PV system.},

This power control strategy allows the inverter to work close to the resonance frequency for all output-power levels. In this situation, zero-voltage switching and zero-current switching conditions are performed, and the switching losses are minimized. An additional improvement of inverter efficiency is achieved by choosing appropriate values of the modulation index. Results are verified experimentally using a prototype for induction hardening applications. A comparative study between the PDM and the classical power control by frequency variation will be made.},

abstract = {Gallium Nitride High Electron Mobility Transistor (GaN HEMT) is an emerging wide band gap power device in recent years. Using a cascoded structure, the GaN HEMT can be combined with a low voltage MOSFET to make the combination behave as a normally-off device. This paper investigates the soft-switching behavior of cascode GaN HEMT in the phase-leg structure. The analysis reveals some internal device behaviors during the soft-switching transition, which are not found in the non-cascode device. Due to the internal feedback of the cascode structure, the channel current of the internal GaN HEMT drops to zero quickly, leading to extremely low turn-off loss. However, it has been found that there are switching energy loss dissipated in the internal GaN HEMT during the turn-on transient, although the external waveforms of the cascode GaN HEMT exhibit zero voltage switching. The fundamental reason is that ratio of the sum of MOSFET output capacitance and internal GaN HEMT input capacitance to the internal GaN HEMT output capacitance is quite low. Based on the simulation, by adding additional capacitance on the gate source terminals of internal GaN HEMT, these losses can be mitigated. Experimental tests using a commercially available GaN device are presented which show nearly 400 mW of loss at 1 MHz switching frequency in four different load current conditions.},

To resolve this problem, a current-control scheme is proposed using duty-ratio feedforward. In this paper, the input impedance of the boost PFC converter for both the classical current-loop controller and the controller using duty-ratio feedforward are derived theoretically. A comparison reveals the advantages of the proposed control scheme: a low total harmonic distortion of the line current, a resistive input impedance, virtually no zero-crossing distortion, and a fundamental displacement power factor close to unity. The theoretical results obtained are verified using an experimental setup of a digitally controlled boost PFC converter.},

The output I-V characteristics of the PV module under real sunlight and that of the proposed emulator were experimentally obtained and compared, such that the functionality of the proposed emulator was verified. An in-depth analysis of the PV module output small-signal impedance is also presented to illustrate the dynamic performance of this emulator.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {The ability to implant electronic systems in the human body has led to many medical advances. Progress in semiconductor technology paved the way for devices at the scale of a millimeter or less ("microimplants"), but the miniaturization of the power source remains challenging. Although wireless powering has been demonstrated, energy transfer beyond superficial depths in tissue has so far been limited by large coils (at least a centimeter in diameter) unsuitable for a microimplant. Here, we show that this limitation can be overcome by a method, termed midfield powering, to create a high-energy density region deep in tissue inside of which the power-harvesting structure can be made extremely small. Unlike conventional near-field (inductively coupled) coils, for which coupling is limited by exponential field decay, a patterned metal plate is used to induce spatially confined and adaptive energy transport through propagating modes in tissue. We use this method to power a microimplant (2 mm, 70 mg) capable of closed-chest wireless control of the heart that is orders of magnitude smaller than conventional pacemakers. With exposure levels below human safety thresholds, milliwatt levels of power can be transferred to a deep-tissue ({\textgreater}5 cm) microimplant for both complex electronic function and physiological stimulation. The approach developed here should enable new generations of implantable systems that can be integrated into the body at minimal cost and risk.},

Several examples are discussed, and the results are compared with Lyapunov's quadratic and quadratic plus integral forms as well as with other methods. For these examples, the results obtained from the new theorem yield less conservative values of gain than Lyapunov's method.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a multimode digitally controlled boost converter with PID autotuning and constant frequency/constant off-time hybrid pulsewidth modulation (PWM) control. Constant off-time PWM control is introduced in this converter for avoiding the limit cycle oscillation and maintaining a constant dc gain of the control-output transfer function for a high conversion ratio. Discrete-time modeling of constant off-time PWM is given and verified. An autotuning PID compensator based on frequency-response measurement is adopted to compensate the output stage with variable gain and variable corner frequency. PFM is also included in this controller to improve light load efficiency. A new method of automatic PWM/PFM mode switching without current sensing is proposed. Sufficient loop stability margin and optimal efficiency are obtained by using these techniques for a boost converter operating over wide ranges of output voltages, load currents, and external components. Experimental results are shown for an asynchronous boost converter with 2.5-V input voltage, 3{\&}{\#}x2013;12{\&}{\#}x2009;V, and 1{\&}{\#}x2013;400 mA output.},

In this work, stability analysis and bifurcations of a SEPIC dc-dc converter, operating in the continuous conduction mode (CCM) and under current-programmed control is carried out by means of a discrete-time model. Large-signal model is built, and its corresponding linearised version is performed in order to study the stability of the nominal (1-periodic orbit) operating regime. Varying the reference current, it is obtained that the system functioning changes from a stable buck-like converter to an unstable boost-like converter. The 1-periodic orbit loses its stability via flip bifurcation (FB) and the resulting attractor is a 2-penodic orbit. This latter, bifurcates to chaos via border collision bifucation (BCB). It will be shown that allows in order to get a boost-like converter with a stable periodic behavior, the control polarity should be inverted.},

abstract = {A zeroth-order-hold equivalent discrete-time model of the buck converter for computing its large-signal frequency response is developed and experimentally verified. It is shown that, with a dc bias and a sinusoidal variation of the input duty cycle, the frequency response of the output voltage from the converter shifts from underdamped behavior to damped behavior with increasing amplitude of the input sinusoid. It is observed that, with a given dc input bias and a given input amplitude beyond the range of the state-space linearized small-signal model, the converter behavior varies from exclusively continuous inductor current mode at low frequencies to behavior with continuous and discontinuous inductor current modes at high frequencies. The use of this sinusoidal input large-signal frequency response in predicting limit cycles induced by feedback of the output voltage using proportional and integral controllers for such converters is studied. Experimental results confirming the use of this large-signal frequency response are presented},

abstract = {Microinverters operating into the single-phase grid from solar photovoltaic (PV) panels or other low-voltage sources must buffer the twice-line-frequency variations between the energy sourced by the PV panel and that required for the grid. Moreover, in addition to operating over wide average power ranges, they inherently operate over a wide range of voltage conversion ratios as the line voltage traverses a cycle. These factors make the design of microinverters challenging. This paper presents a multilevel energy buffer and voltage modulator (MEB) that significantly reduces the range of voltage conversion ratios that the dc-ac converter portion of the microinverter must operate over by stepping its effective input voltage in pace with the line voltage. The MEB partially replaces the original bulk input capacitor, and functions as an active energy buffer to reduce the total size of the twice-line-frequency energy buffering capacitance. The small additional loss of the MEB can be compensated by the improved efficiency of the dc-ac converter stage, leading to a higher overall system efficiency. The MEB architecture can be implemented in a variety of manners, allowing different design tradeoffs to be made. A prototype microinverter incorporating an MEB, designed for 27 to 38 V dc input voltage, 230-V rms ac output voltage, and rated for a line cycle average power of 70 W, has been built and tested in a grid-connected mode. It is shown that the MEB can successfully enhance the performance of a single-phase grid-interfaced microinverter by increasing its efficiency and reducing the total size of the twice-line-frequency energy buffering capacitance.},

abstract = {Single-phase universal-input ac-dc converters are needed in a wide range of applications. This paper presents a novel power factor correction (PFC) architecture that can achieve high power density and high efficiency for grid-interface power electronics. The proposed Multitrack PFC architecture is a new development of the Multitrack concept. It reduces the internal device voltage stress of the power converter subsystems, allowing PFC circuits to maintain zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) at high frequency (1 MHz-4 MHz) across universal input voltage range (85 VAC-265 VAC). The high performance of the power converter is enabled by delivering power in multiple stacked voltage domains and reconfiguring the power processing paths depending on the input voltage. This Multitrack concept can be used together with many other design techniques for PFC systems to create mutual advantages in many function blocks. A prototype 150 W, universal ac input, 12 VDC output, isolated Multitrack PFC system with a power density of 50 W/in{\textless}formula{\textgreater}{\textless}tex{\textgreater}{\$}{\^{}}3{\$}{\textless}/tex{\textgreater}{\textless}/formula{\textgreater} and a peak end-to-end efficiency of 92{\%} has been built and tested to verify the effectiveness of the Multitrack PFC architecture.},

abstract = {The main focus of this paper is the implementation of mixed-signal peak current mode control in low-power dc-dc converters for portable applications. A DAC is used to link the digital voltage loop compensator to the analog peak current mode loop. Conventional DAC architectures, such as flash or {\&}x0394;{\&}x03A3; are not suitable due to excessive power consumption and limited bandwidth of the reconstruction filter, respectively. The charge-pump based DAC (CP-DAC) used in this work has relatively poor linearity compared to more expensive DAC topologies; however, this can be tolerated since the linearity has a minor effect on the converter dynamics as long as the limit-cycle conditions are met. The CP-DAC has a guaranteed monotonic behavior from the digital current command to the peak inductor current, which is essential for maintaining stability. A buck converter IC, which was fabricated in a 0.18 {\&}x03BC;m CMOS process with 5 V compatible transistors, achieves a response time of 4 {\&}x03BC;s at fs=3 MHz and Vout=1 V, for a 200 mA load-step. The active area of the controller is only 0.077 mm2, and the total controller current-draw, which is heavily dominated by the on-chip senseFET current-sensor, is below 250 {\&}x03BC;A for a load current of Iout=50 mA.},

abstract = {A lossless multi-way outphasing and power combining system for microwave power amplification is presented. The architecture addresses one of the primary drawbacks of Chireix outphasing; namely, the sub-optimal loading conditions for the branch power amplifiers. In the proposed system, four saturated power amplifiers interact through a lossless power combining network to produce nearly resistive load modulation over a 10:1 range of output powers. This work focuses on two microstrip-based power combiner implementations: a hybrid microstrip/discrete implementation using a combination of microstrip transmission line sections with discrete shunt elements, and an all-microstrip implementation incorporating open-circuited radial stubs. We demonstrate and compare these techniques in a 2.14 GHz power amplifier system. With the all-microstrip implementation, the system demonstrates a peak CW drain efficiency of 70{\%} and drain efficiency of over 60{\%} over a 6.5-dB outphasing output power range with a peak power of over 100 W. We demonstrate W-CDMA modulation with 55.6{\%} average modulated efficiency at 14.1 W average output power for a 9.15-dB peak to average power ratio (PAPR) signal. The performance of this all-microstrip system is compared to that of the proposed hybrid microstrip/discrete version and a previously reported implementation in discrete lumped-element form.},

The proposed digital controller adopts the push–pull mode control scheme, which executes the control action two times in one switching period, to minimise the time delay and enhance the performance. Using a 150 W experimental converter, the performance of the proposed push–pull mode digital control is demonstrated in comparison with that of the conventional complementary mode digital control, which performs the control action only once in one switching period.},

abstract = {Wide bandgap III-nitride semiconductor materials possess superior material properties as compared to silicon, GaAs and other III-V compound materials. Recent achievements in gallium nitride (GaN) technology for optoelectronics have resulted in ultra-bright blue light emitting diodes and lasers, ultraviolet emitters, and solar-blind optical detectors. In the electronic area, drastic improvement of microwave device performance has been achieved, yielding record high power densities of 20-30 W/mm. Novel applications of these materials in high-power electronics for switching, energy conversion and control are just emerging. This paper provides an overview of the state-of-the-art III-nitride wide bandgap technologies and it explores power electronic applications while illustrating the enormous potential that GaN based devices have for overcoming the major challenges of power electronics in the 21st century. The paper discusses the unique material and device properties of GaN-based semiconductors that make them promising for high-power, high-temperature applications. These include high electron mobility and saturation velocity, high sheet carrier concentration at heterojunction interfaces, high breakdown voltages, and low thermal impedance (when grown over SiC or bulk AIN substrates). The chemical inertness and radiation hardness of nitrides are other key properties. As applied to power electronics, the Ill-Nitride technology allows for high-power switching with sub-microsecond and nano-second switching times. The paper will present the innovations that further improve the performance of high-power DC-DC converters, switches and other building blocks. These include novel insulated gate HFET design that significantly expands the allowable input voltage amplitude, further increases the device peak currents, and most importantly, tremendously improves the large-signal stability and reliability. Insulated gate switching devices have been shown to operate at up to 300 degC wit- - h no noticeable parameter degradation. Novel monolithic integrated circuits of high-power switches and DC-DC converters and their performance parameters will be presented. The paper also discusses the major challenges associated with modern GaN technology and work in progress to overcome them},

This paper presents a digital sliding mode controller for a two-phase interleaved buck converter. Rather than a direct current measurement, a sliding mode observer is proposed to digitally reconstruct the inductor currents. Moreover, a constant switching frequency is achieved by synchronizing the pulse-width modulation (PWM) signals to a clock.

abstract = {This paper introduces a digitally-controlled buck converter with adaptive core biasing that allows for minimization of the output capacitor as well as of the inductor core. The improved performances are obtained through adaptive relocation of the converter operating point on the B-H curve of the inductor core, with the help of a digitally controlled low-power biasing circuit and an extra inductor winding. During transients, the point is set in the saturation region, so the inductance is drastically reduced. As a result the inductor current slew rate and, consequently, load transient response are improved allowing output capacitor reduction. The biasing is also used to reduce flux density allowing the core volume minimization. Experimental verifications with a 3.3 V, 30 W, 500 kHz prototype show that the adaptive biasing system has about two times smaller voltage deviation than the conventional buck allowing for proportional reduction in the output capacitance and for about 40{\%} reduction in the magnetic core size. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

This power control circuit incorporates a load-adaptive variable frequency controller and an automated blanking time management in order to allow that the inverter works in zero-voltage switching (ZVS) for all output power levels and load conditions. An important improvement of the inverter reliability is achieved by choosing an appropriate and novel switching sequence for the PS inverter.

abstract = {Analysis of LiDAR technology for Advanced Safety Preface Safety and its improvement is a concern paramount to all passenger vehicle manufacturers. The value proposition for driver, passenger and pedestrian safety has become equally important as engine performance and fuel economy. This paper addresses how light detection and range (LiDAR) technology will impact Advanced Driver Assistance Systems and explore the term, " autonomous driving intelligence. " The paper will consider Lidar technology today and how it stands to capture a large market share of automotive sensor technology in the future. Lidar is poised to penetrate the market in 2016 as the lead technology in automotive safety and autonomous systems. Three primary approaches to Lidar development are considered, including Hybrid Solid-State Lidar, MEMS Lidar, and Mechanical Mechanism Lidar. Mechanical mechanism Lidar is the oldest and most traditional technology. MEMS Lidar technology is in the beginning stage of development as a low cost Lidar solution for low level automotive safety. Solid-state Hybrid Lidar (SH Lidar) was introduced in 2005 as a result of the Darpa Robotic Car Races. The technology has been tested for autonomous safety over the years and the cost for SH Lidar dropped dramatically in 2015. With planned mass production to meet the growing demand for autonomous navigation and advanced safety, further dramatic cost reduction is expected in 2016 – 2017. The development of Solid-State Hybrid Lidar (SH Lidar) was a break away from the traditional mechanical mechanism of single Lidar technology, and it is described in detail in this paper. The technology simplified what was previously a complex mechanical system of parts into one robust solid-state part. The solid-state developmental enabled faster data capture in 3D, capturing pictures instantaneously while moving in real-time at speeds of 30-40MPH. SH Lidar technology has matured from an extremely costly technology and large system to being affordable, smaller in size, and headed toward mass production. SH Lidar technology is poised to be commercialized in 2015-16 and radically change the way we move about in the world.},

The experimentally investigated heat sink is a subcomponent of an unconventional heat exchanger with an integrated fan, designed to meet the challenges of thermal management in compact electronic systems. The close integration of impeller blades with heat transfer surfaces results in a decreased thermal resistance per unit pumping power. The performance of the parallel plate air-cooled heat sink was experimentally characterized and empirically modeled in terms of nondimensional parameters. Dimensionless heat fluxes as high as 48 were measured, which was shown to be about twice the heat transfer rate of a traditional heat sink design using pressure-driven air flow at the same mass flow rate. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

A method is proposed to accurately extract the device package parasitic inductance, which is of vital importance to better predict the high-frequency switching performance of the device. The simulation model is verified by a double-pulse tester, and the results match well both in terms of device switching waveform and switching energy. Based on the simulation model, an investigation of the package influence on the cascode GaN HEMT is presented, and several critical parasitic inductances are identified and verified. Finally, a detailed loss breakdown is made for a buck converter, including a comparison between hard switching and soft switching. The results indicate that the switching loss is a dominant part of the total loss under hard-switching conditions in megahertz high-frequency range and below 8{\~{}}10 A operation current; therefore, soft switching is preferred to achieve high-frequency and high-efficiency operation of the high-voltage GaN HEMT.},

abstract = {A high switching frequency multi-phase buck converter architecture using a time-based compensator is presented. Efficiency degradation due to mismatch between the phases is mitigated by generating precisely matched duty-cycles by combining a time-based multi-phase generator (MPG) with a time-based PID compensator (T-PID). The proposed approach obviates the need for a complex current sensing and calibration circuitry needed to implement active current sharing in an analog controller. It also eliminates the need for a high resolution analog-to-digital converter and digital pulse width modulator needed for implementing passive current sharing in a digital controller. Fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS process, the prototype multi-phase buck converter occupies an active area of 0.32 mm2, of which the controller occupies only 0.04 mm2. The converter operates over a wide range of switching frequencies (30-70 MHz) and regulates output to any desired voltage in the range of 0.6 V to 1.5 V from 1.8 V input voltage. With a 400 mA step in the load current, the settling time is less than 0.6 $\mu$s and the measured duty-cycle mismatch is less than 0.48{\%}. Better than 87{\%} peak efficiency is achieved while consuming a quiescent current of only 3 $\mu$A/MHz.},

The output power and efficiency of each machine is evaluated when utilized with a switched-mode boost rectifier and operating at the load matched condition. A direct mathematical comparison of the sizing equations for the four classes of machines is offered. Based on the analysis, the Lundell alternator has the highest power output and efficiency when compared at the same dimensions and field ampere turns excitation.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Modular photovoltaic (PV) power conditioning systems (PCSs) require a high-efficiency dc-dc converter stage capable of regulation over a wide input voltage range for maximum power point tracking. In order to mitigate ground leakage currents and to be able to use a high-efficiency, nonisolated grid-tied inverter, it is also desirable for this microconverter to provide galvanic isolation between the PV module and the inverter. This paper presents a novel, isolated topology that is able to meet the high efficiency over a wide input voltage range requirement. This topology yields high efficiency through low circulating currents, zero-voltage switching (ZVS) and low-current switching of the primary side devices, ZCS of the output diodes, and direct power transfer to the load for the majority of switching cycle. This topology is also able to provide voltage regulation through basic fixed-frequency pulsewidth modulated (PWM) control. These features are able to be achieved with the simple addition of a secondary-side bidirectional ac switch to the isolated series resonant converter. Detailed analysis of the operation of this converter is discussed along with a detailed design procedure. Experimental results of a 300-W prototype are given. The prototype reached a peak power stage efficiency of 98.3{\%} and a California Energy Commission (CEC) weighted power stage efficiency of 98.0{\%} at the nominal input voltage.},

abstract = {Parallel-form switch-linear hybrid (SLH) envelope tracking (ET) power supply is constituted by a linear amplifier and a switched-mode converter connected in parallel. The switched-mode converter is usually implemented by a buck converter with hysteresis current control. However, the slew rates of the load current and the inductor current of the buck converter can not match well when the slew rate of the load current has a wide variation range. The unmatched slew rates will lead to a high switching frequency of the buck converter or a large loss of the linear amplifier. In this paper, a multilevel converter is adopted to replace the buck converter, and the hysteresis current control scheme is proposed for the multilevel converter to dynamically adjust its inductor current slew rate to approach that of the load current to improve the overall efficiency. The optimal design for the efficiency-related parameters is given. A prototype of the parallel-form SLH ET power supply with hysteresis current controlled multilevel converter is fabricated in the lab. The measured overall efficiency is 79.4{\%} when tracking the envelope of WCDMA signal with 5 MHz bandwidth and outputs 18W average power, and a 3.8{\%} efficiency improvement is achieved over that with the hysteresis current controlled buck converter.

The topology we examine features a low parts count and fast transient response but suffers from higher device stresses compared to other topologies that use a larger number of passive components. A numerical design procedure is developed for this topology that does not rely on time-domain simulation sweeps across parameters. This allows the optimal converter design to be found for a particular main semiconductor switch. If an integrated power process is used where the designer has control over layout of the semiconductor switch, the optimal combination of converter design and semiconductor layout can be found. To validate the proposed converter topology and design approach, a 75 MHz prototype converter is designed and experimentally demonstrated. The performance of the prototype closely matches that predicted by the design procedure, and achieves good efficiency over a wide input voltage range.},

First, this paper presents a new derivation of practical charge balance equations based on simplified differential equations. This deviation is applicable to both fast input voltage and load step transients. The final algorithm does not require complex calculations and accurate knowledge of the output filter LC parameter. Second, the proposed voltage-based charge balance controller does not require accurate current sensor or fast analog-to-digital converter. Instead, to detect the critical time instant when the inductor current equals the new load current, a practical extreme voltage detector is introduced to capture the output voltage peak/valley information. Third, this algorithm is simple to be implemented by either low-cost digital signal processing devices (such as microcontroller unit) or analog circuits. Both digital and analog experimental prototypes are built to verify the feasibility and advantages of the new method. {\textcopyright} 1986-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a technique for improving the high-frequency performance of filter inductors and common-mode chokes by cancelling out the effects of parasitic capacitance. This technique uses additional passive components to inject a compensation current that cancels the parasitic current, thereby improving high-frequency filtering performance. Two implementation approaches for this technique are introduced. The first implementation achieves cancellation using an additional small winding on the filter inductor and a small capacitor. This approach is effective where very high coupling of the windings can be achieved or where only moderate performance improvements are required. The second implementation utilizes a small radio frequency transformer in parallel with the filter inductor to inject cancellation currents from the compensation capacitor. This technique requires an additional component (the transformer), but can provide a high degree of cancellation. Experimental results confirm the theory in both implementations.},

abstract = {This paper presents a historical and philosophical perspective on a possible future for power electronics. Technologies have specific life cycles that are driven by internal innovation, subsequently reaching maturity. Power electronics appears to be a much more complex case, functioning as an enabling technology spanning an enormous range of power levels, functions and applications. Power electronics is also divided into many constituent technologies. Till now, the development of power electronics has been driven chiefly by internal semiconductor technology and converter circuit technology, approaching maturity in its internally set metrics, such as efficiency. This paper examines critically the fundamental functions found in electronic energy processing, the constituent technologies comprising power electronics, and the power electronics technology space in light of the internal driving philosophy of power electronics and its historical development. It is finally concluded that, although approaching the limits of its internal metrics indicates internal maturity, the external constituent technologies of packaging, manufacturing, electromagnetic and physical impact, and converter control technology still present remarkable opportunities for development. As power electronics is an enabling technology, its development, together with internal developments, such as wide bandgap semiconductors, will be driven externally by applications in the future.},

The apparent association and dissociation rate constants, as well as the overall Ki values, were only modestly different for the two neuraminidase strains. The time dependent inhibition phenomenon, often referred to as slow-binding inhibition, appears to be a consequence of the very slow rate of dissociation of the compound from influenza neuraminidase.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a novel coordinated voltage-control (CVC) scheme for distributed generations (DGs) that relies on adaptively changing the roles (master or slave) of the devices [inverter-based DG, diesel generator, and online tap changer (OLTC)] within the smart grid, depending on system conditions. In addition, the proposed scheme imposes different control response and bandwidth on the devices to coordinate the reactive power among distributed generations (DGs) and OLTC steps. The main objective of the proposed method is twofold: 1) to maximize the reactive power reserve of DGs and, hence, facilitate reaction during contingency situations and 2) to provide voltage regulation during normal operating conditions. The simulated distribution system includes inverter-based DGs (photovoltaic and wind turbine), diesel generator, and OLTC and the potential of the CVC scheme is evaluated and analyzed in view of improving voltage profile, maximizing the reactive power reserve, enhancing fault ride through and improving the transient stability margin. The control algorithm is examined under steady state, load excursion, and three-phase-to-ground fault conditions. The results demonstrate the ability of the proposed CVC scheme to satisfy the targeted objectives with significant improvement in the maximum critical clearing time. The proposed scheme is independent of real-time measurements and is widely adaptive to the dynamics of power systems, thus making it quite suitable for utility implementation.},

A digital circuit that generates the best of the analyzed modulation profiles is implemented in a field programmable gate array. The design is modeled in a very-high-speed integrated circuits hardware description language (VHDL). The digital circuit, the power converter, and the spectrum analyzer are simulated all together using a mixed-signal simulation tool to verify the functionality of the VHDL description. The spectrum analyzer is modeled in VHDL-analog and mixed-signal extension language (VHDL-AMS) and takes into account the resolution bandwidth stipulated by the EMI measurement standard. Finally, the simulations are experimentally verified on a 3.5 kW resonant inverter operating at 35 kHz.},

A variable speed drive-controlled induction motor model is also established for the adjustment of the VSHP input power. A dynamic model of an experimental room is then developed to estimate the effect of the DLC application to the VSHP on its indoor air temperature for two different cooling systems. Furthermore, small signal analysis is performed to evaluate both the transient response of the DLC-enabled VSHP and its contribution to GFR. Finally, with an isolated microgrid implemented with Matlab/Simulink, simulation studies demonstrate that the VSHP can be effectively exploited as the DLC-enabled load while still ensuring building occupant comfort and long-term device performance.},

Therefore, an accurate model for constant on-time control is indispensable to system design. However, available models for constant on-time control are unable to provide accurate physical insight or predict system response very well. This paper introduces a new modeling approach for constant on-time control. The inductor, the switches, and the pulsewidth-modulated modulator are treated as a single entity and modeled based on the describing function method. The fundamental difference between constant on-time control and constant-frequency peak-current-mode control is analyzed through the proposed model. This proposed modeling method can be easily extended to other current-mode controls, including V{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} controls. A simple equivalent circuit representation is proposed for the sake of easy understanding and simulation of current-mode controls.

abstract = {A variable frequency transformer (VFT) is being considered as a new alternative to the classical back-to-back high voltage direct current (HVDC) link for interconnection of two asynchronous networks. The VFT is a retrospective form of frequency converter using the wound rotor induction machine (WRIM), which converts the constant frequency input into a variable frequency output. The prime objective of VFT is to achieve controlled bidirectional power transfer between the two asynchronous networks. This paper presents a detailed working principle of VFT technology and proposes a new hierarchical control strategy for establishing the VFT connection with two power systems to achieve bidirectional power transfer between them. Also, to restrict the grid fault propagation from one side of the VFT to the other side, a series dynamic braking resistor based fault ride-through (FRT) scheme is proposed. The performance of the VFT during the synchronization process, steady-state, dynamic, and the grid fault conditions is evaluated using the real-time hardware in-loop (HIL) system. The plant is simulated in real time using OPAL-RT real-time simulator while the control algorithm is implemented in digital signal processor to carry out HIL study. All the important results supporting the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy and FRT scheme are discussed.},

A digital PI compensator with programmable gain was used to stabilize the control loop for different LED current levels.Experimental results are presented. Same design considerations apply to other applications if a digitally-controlled boost or buck/boost converter with high conversion gain is used.},

abstract = {Conventional DC-DC step-up converters present problems of low efficiency and low power density because of: 1. High power losses caused by hard-switching and reverse-recovery phenomenon. 2. High conduction losses produced by large peak currents when the converter has to operate at a high duty cycle. 3. Bulky and heavy cooling systems needed to dissipate the semiconductors losses. And, 4. Big and heavy capacitors and inductors required for smoothing and decoupling. Therefore, a novel Zero-Current-Switching two-phase interleaved boost converter with saturable inductors for reverse-recovery reduction is proposed. This converter can reduce the switching losses in the semiconductors due to the effect of the saturable inductors. Moreover, downsizing of the inductors and the output capacitor can be achieved due to the interleaving technique and the use of saturable inductors. In addition, high step-up operation can be achieved due to the presence of tapped-inductors. In this paper, the circuit configuration and the operation principle of the proposed converter and the reverse-recovery reduction behavior are presented. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed converter is experimentally validated with a 600W prototype where a recovery-reduction of 58{\%} was achieved. I.},

abstract = {This paper presents steady-state and small-signal models for digital pulsewidth modulators (DPWM) employed in multiple sampling digital control schemes for dc-dc switched mode power supplies (SMPS), and identifies the triangular modulation as intrinsically superior to other modulation schemes in multisampling applications. In conventional digital control of dc-dc converters, closed-loop bandwidth limitations are mainly set by analog-to-digital conversion times, computational delays and DPWM delays originated by the sampled nature of the PWM. While the use of hardwired logic and fast A/D converters minimizes computational and A/D delays, the DPWM small-signal phase lag strictly depends on the adopted sampling strategy. Multiple sampling techniques recently proposed in literature can achieve a strong reduction of the DPWM delay by operating the control and modulation steps at a sampling frequency strictly higher than the converter switching frequency. On the other hand, multisampled pulse width modulators (MSPWMs) exhibit nonlinear behaviors which do not have analog counterparts nor are encountered in conventional digital control, the most relevant effect being the onset of sampling induced dead bands, i.e., regions of zero modulation gain in the modulator transcharacteristic which may compromise proper closed-loop operation of the converter. The models proposed in this paper fully characterize the steady-state and small-signal behavior of DPWMs operated in multiple-sampling fashion. Multisampled triangular modulators are proven to be intrinsically superior to trailing edge or leading edge modulators in terms of linearity. Simulation and experimental results validate the proposed models and confirm the properties of triangular modulations.},

abstract = {In this paper, a digital control approach is investigated for time-optimal load step response of DC-DC synchronous buck converters intended for point-of-load (PoL) applications and employing low-equivalent series resistance ceramic output capacitors. Unlike previously reported approaches, the proposed technique is insensitive to converter parametric variations and design uncertainties, as its operation does not rely on the knowledge of the output filter inductance or capacitance. The time-optimal response is achieved through a single on/off switching action undertaken as soon as a load transient is detected. In its most general formulation, the proposed technique automatically incorporates adaptive voltage positioning (AVP) regulation, according to the typical droop design guidelines for powering modern microprocessors. A simpler version, suitable for voltage-mode controlled PoL converters not requiring AVP positioning, is also presented. The technique employs an asynchronous A/D conversion scheme, which quantizes the converter state variables and triggers a nonlinear, event-based digital controller whenever a quantization level transition is detected. Additional sensing requirements are not needed, since the time-optimal transient is achieved through the measurement of the output voltage and, whenever AVP regulation is needed, of the phase currents. Effectiveness and properties of the proposed robust time-optimal approach are validated through both computer simulations and experimental tests on a synchronous buck converter prototype and a VHDL implementation of the control algorithm on an field programmable gate array device.},

The receiver also consists of a one pair of aluminum plates that are capacitively coupled with the transmitter plates. The capacitive coupling delivers power to the receiver. An LCLC compensation topology is used at both the transmitter and receiver sides to provide resonances which boost the plate voltage in order to transfer power. A 150W prototype of a dynamic CPT system is designed and implemented. Each transmitter plate size is 1200mm×300mm, and each receiver plate size is 300mm×300mm. The switching frequency is 1.5MHz, and the DC-DC efficiency reaches 85.4{\%}. When the receiver moves along the transmitter track, the output power varies within ±4.0{\%} of the nominal power.},

The topology we examine features a low parts count and fast transient response but suffers from higher device stresses compared to other topologies that use a larger number of passive components. A numerical design procedure is developed for this topology that does not rely on time-domain simulation sweeps across parameters. This allows the optimal converter design to be found for a particular main semiconductor switch. If an integrated power process is used where the designer has control over layout of the semiconductor switch, the optimal combination of converter design and semiconductor layout can be found. To validate the proposed converter topology and design approach, a 75 MHz prototype converter is designed and experimentally demonstrated. The performance of the prototype closely matches that predicted by the design procedure, and achieves good efficiency over a wide input voltage range.},

Whereas conventional outphasing systems utilize two power amplifiers, the system introduced here combines power from four or more amplifiers. The proposed technique overcomes the loss and reactive loading problems of previous outphasing systems. It provides ideally lossless power combining, along with resistive loading of the individual power amplifiers over a very wide output power range. A conceptual development illustrating the operating principles of the system is provided, along with a representative design, detailed analysis, and supporting simulations. The relation of the proposed technique to multi-level resistance compression is also described. It is anticipated that the new power combining and outphasing modulation approach will find widespread use in applications where both high linearity and high efficiency are desired.},

abstract = {This paper investigates a special class of dynamic power system problem, namely subsynchronous resonance (SSR) resulted from a series-compensated network connecting doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) based wind farms. A novel two-degree-of-freedom (2DOF) control strategy combined with a damping control loop is designed and analyzed for enhancing the system stability and alleviates the SSR that may arise due to the induction generator effect (IGE). The proposed control strategy is tested at different operating conditions of series compensation levels and low wind speeds to ensure the system stability. The doubly-fed induction generator based wind farms without the proposed control strategy leads to overall system instability during high series compensation and low wind speeds. Hence, the mitigation of the SSR and damping enhancement are critical to the entire power system stability. A reliable way of analyzing the system and designing effective control strategies against SSR based on the eigenvalue analysis and impedance based stability criterion is deployed. Moreover, analytical explanations have been elaborated to verify the procedure of the controller design. Fault ride-though capability has also been investigated with the proposed control strategy that is flexible to be integrated with the FRT schemes so as to assist the wind farm in mitigating the SSR during the fault recovery stage. Finally, time domain simulations are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy for mitigating the SSR and damping power system oscillations.},

Hence, the ICN converter is able to operate at fixed frequency and maintain high efficiency across wide ranges in input and output voltages and output power. The ICN converter architecture enables increase in switching frequency (hence reducing size and mass) while achieving very high efficiency. A prototype 200 W, 500 kHz ICN resonant converter designed to operate over an input voltage range of 25 V to 40 V and output voltage range of 250 V to 400 V is built and tested. The prototype ICN converter achieves a peak efficiency of 97.2{\%}, maintains greater than 96.2{\%} full power efficiency at 250 V output voltage across the nearly 2:1 input voltage range, and maintains full power efficiency above 94.6{\%} across its full input and output voltage range. It also maintains efficiency above 93.4{\%} over a 10:1 output power range across its full input and output voltage range owing to the use of burst-mode control.},

When the conversion to eLoran is complete, the eLoran system will use time-of-transmission (TOT) control similar to GPS, and add a 9th pulse or Loran data channel (LDC) that will distribute UTC, leap second, and other information from each of the 29 transmitters in North America. eLoran provides performance comparable to GPS for numerous time and frequency applications, so eLoran can act as a traceable, infinite, and independent backup to GPS in these applications.

abstract = {Active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) can be summarized as follows: it inherits from proportional-integral-derivative (PID) the quality that makes it such a success: the error driven, rather than model-based, control law; it takes from modern control theory its best offering: the state observer; it embraces the power of nonlinear feedback and puts it to full use; it is a useful digital control technology developed out of an experimental platform rooted in computer simulations. ADRC is made possible only when control is taken as an experimental science, instead of a mathematical one. It is motivated by the ever increasing demands from industry that requires the control technology to move beyond PID, which has dominated the practice for over 80 years. Specifically, there are four areas of weakness in PID that we strive to address: 1) the error computation; 2) noise degradation in the derivative control; 3) oversimplification and the loss of performance in the control law in the form of a linear weighted sum; and 4) complications brought by the integral control. Correspondingly, we propose four distinct measures: 1) a simple differential equation as a transient trajectory generator; 2) a noise-tolerant tracking differentiator; 3) the nonlinear control laws; and 4) the concept and method of total disturbance estimation and rejection. Together, they form a new set of tools and a new way of control design. Times and again in experiments and on factory floors, ADRC proves to be a capable replacement of PID with unmistakable advantage in performance and practicality, providing solutions to pressing engineering problems of today. With the new outlook and possibilities that ADRC represents, we further believe that control engineering may very well break the hold of classical PID and enter a new era, an era that brings back the spirit of innovations.},

Switch turn-off is determined synchronously by the system clock. In the proposed approach, the derivative action of the proportional-integral-derivative voltage-mode controller is inherently obtained by the frequency modulation, without requiring the digital computation of the derivative action. A simplified small-signal model is also derived in order to analyze the performance achievable by the proposed solution.

abstract = {Our development of an Automated Test System (ATS) for Proximity Sensor Electronic Units (PSEUs) in the aircraft industry required the implementation of a variable inductor. The variable inductor simulates inductive proximity sensors so the ATS can measure and verify the switch points of the electronics as the sensors move between their near and far states. Though developed for PSEU testing, the presented methodology and technology may be applied to other test equipment and applications that require a variable inductor. The paper begins by looking at different techniques for implementing a variable inductor: moving cores, switched decade boxes, gyrator circuitry and saturable core reactors. The paper presents the pros and cons of the different technologies and then focuses on the development of a saturable core reactor as the chosen technology. The paper presents fundamental formulae used during the development of the variable inductor and test results for a number of developed prototypes. The presentation includes the development of a highly-accurate control loop to precisely hold the value of the controlled inductance. Finally, the paper concludes with a brief discussion of the ATS that ultimately housed the variable inductor.},

abstract = {This paper presents a high-performance DC-DC switching mode power supply designed to deliver a regulated 0-50 V/0-10 A output. The proposed power supply is based on a modified version of the zero-voltage switching (ZVS) full-bridge (FB) phase-shift DC-DC converter, which incorporates commutation auxiliary inductors to provide ZVS for the entire load range as well as a commutation aid circuit to clamp the output diode voltage. The control strategy is based on two control loops operating in cascade mode. The inner loop maintains a regulated output current, whereas the external voltage loop regulates the output voltage, independently of load and input-voltage changes. In order to obtain a high-reliability converter, the control circuit has been implemented using just two integrated circuits (ICs). The phase-shift regulator UC3875 IC generates the gate drive signal to the MOSFET's. The control loop regulators are implemented using the TL074 IC. A theoretical analysis was conducted, and experimental results were obtained for a 0-50 V/0-10 A power supply operating at 100 kHz},

@article{Niroui2015,
abstract = {Abrupt switching behavior and near-zero leakage current of nanoelectromech. (NEM) switches are advantageous properties through which NEMs can outperform conventional semiconductor elec. switches.  To date, however, typical NEMs structures require high actuation voltages and can prematurely fail through permanent adhesion (defined as stiction) of device components.  To overcome these challenges, the authors propose a NEM switch, termed a squitch, which is designed to electromechanically modulate the tunneling current through a nanometer-scale gap defined by an org. mol. film sandwiched between two electrodes.  When voltage is applied across the electrodes, the generated electrostatic force compresses the sandwiched mol. layer, thereby reducing the tunneling gap and causing an exponential increase in the current through the device.  The presence of the mol. layer avoids direct contact of the electrodes during the switching process.  Also, as the layer is compressed, the increasing surface adhesion forces are balanced by the elastic restoring force of the deformed mols. which can promote zero net stiction and recoverable switching.  Through numerical anal., the authors demonstrate the potential of optimizing squitch design to enable large on-off ratios beyond 6 orders of magnitude with operation in the sub-1 V regime and with nanoseconds switching times.  The preliminary exptl. results based on metal-mol.-graphene devices suggest the feasibility of the proposed tunneling switching mechanism.  With optimization of device design and material engineering, squitches can give rise to a broad range of low-power electronic applications. [on SciFinder(R)]},

The proposed design features high efficiency over a wide input and output voltage range, up-and-down voltage conversion, small size, and excellent transient performance. In addition, a resonant gate drive scheme is presented which provides rapid startup and low-loss at HF and VHF frequencies. The converter regulates the output using an on-off control scheme modulating at a fixed frequency. This control method enables fast transient response and efficient light load operation while providing controlled spectral characteristics of the input and output waveforms. An experimental prototype has been built and evaluated. The prototype converter, built with two commercial vertical MOSFETs, operates at a fixed switching frequency of 20 MHz, with an input voltage range of 3.6 V to 7.2 V, an output voltage range of 3 V to 9 V and an output power rating of up to 3 W. The converter achieves higher than 80{\%} efficiency across the entire input voltage range at nominal output voltage, and maintains good efficiency across the whole operating range.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

In this paper the MIMO versions of the three stability criteria are derived using Popov's theory of hyperstability. The main contribution is the presentation of new methods for a frequency domain evaluation of the sector criteria in the multivariable case.

abstract = {The increased efficiency and quality constraints imposed on electrical energy systems have inspired a renewed research interest in the study of formal approaches to the analysis and control of power electronics converters. Switched systems represent a useful framework for modeling these converters and the peculiarities of their operating conditions and control goals justify the specific classification of “switched electronic systems”. Indeed, idealized switched models of power converters introduce problems not commonly encountered when analyzing generic switched models or non-switched electrical networks. In that sense the analysis of switched electronic systems represents a source for new ideas and benchmarks for switched and hybrid systems generally. Dynamics and Control of Switched Electronic Systems draws on the expertise of an international group of expert contributors to give an overview of recent advances in the modeling, simulation and control of switched electronic systems. The reader is provided with a well-organized source of references and a mathematically-based report of the state of the art in analysis and design techniques for switched power converters. Intuitive language, realistic illustrative examples and numerical simulations help the reader to come to grips with the rigorous presentation of many promising directions of research such as: converter topologies and modulation techniques; continuous-time, discrete-time and hybrid models; modern control strategies for power converters; and challenges in numerical simulation. The guidance and information imparted in this text will be appreciated by engineers, and applied mathematicians working on system and circuit theory, control systems development, and electronic and energy conversion systems design. Advances in Industrial Control aims to report and encourage the transfer of technology in control engineering. The rapid development of control technology has an impact on all areas of the control discipline. The series offers an opportunity for researchers to present an extended exposition of new work in all aspects of industrial control.},

The pro- posed equivalent circuit is based on the unified equivalent circuit of current mode controls. It is a completed frequency domain model for V 2 control with a clear physical insight. V 2 control can be interpreted as an advanced implementation of current mode con- trol with a proportional voltage feedback and an additional load current feedback. The load current feedback dramatically reduces the output impedance of a currentmode controlled converter.

abstract = {In this paper, a new control algorithm is proposed to achieve optimal dynamic performance for dc-to-dc converters under a load current change and for a given set of circuit parameters, such as the output inductor, output capacitor, switching frequency, input voltage, and output voltage. Using the concept of capacitor charge balance, the proposed algorithm predicts the optimal transient response for a dc-to-dc converter during a large signal load current change. During steady state operation, conventional current mode proportional-integral-derivative (PID) is used. During large signal transient conditions, the new control algorithm takes over. The equations needed to calculate the transient time and the required duty cycle series are presented. By using the proposed algorithm, the optimal transient performances, including the smallest output voltage overshoot/undershoot and the shortest recovery time, is achieved. In addition, since the large signal dynamic response of the power converter is successfully predicted, the large signal stability is guaranteed. Experimental results show that the proposed method produces superior dynamic performance over a conventional current mode PID controller.},

However, the use of the latest low voltage power MOSFET generations and the continuously increasing range of switching frequencies have made it necessary to review this model to account for the parasitic inductances that it does not include. This paper presents a complete analytical switching loss model for power MOSFETs in low voltage switching converters that includes the most relevant parasitic elements. It clarifies the switching process, providing information about how these parasitics, especially the inductances, determine switching losses and hence the final converter efficiency. The analysis presented in this paper yields two different types of possible switching situations: capacitance-limited switching and inductance-limited switching. This paper shows that, while the piecewise linear model may be applied in the former, the proposed model is more accurate for the latter. Carefully-obtained experimental results, described in detail, support the analytical results presented.},

abstract = {This paper is focused on core size optimization of power inductors in bidirectional dc-dc converters. It presents an experimental large-signal characterization procedure for power inductors in electric vehicle applications and a method to obtain an inductance reference value for the power inductor in dc-dc converters' simulation studies. It discusses the importance of the inductor design project by describing important constraints such as core size and saturation. The main contribution of this paper is related to the proposed dc flux cancelation technique in the bidirectional converter. A variable inductor prototype is used to replace the power inductor in order to decrease core size by improving the ripple content of the inductor current. The saturation level of the core is controlled by means of an auxiliary winding whether the converter operates in buck or boost mode. Experimental results validate the proposed methodology showing more than 50{\%} reduction in magnetic material for similar current levels.},

abstract = {This paper presents a study on the effect of increasing the inverter-based Distributed Generators (DGs) penetration in the dynamics and stability of a hybrid Microgrid. An analysis is also done to compare different inverter control techniques as a way to reduce voltage and frequency variations after a disturbance. The purpose of this study is to compare Microgrids with different percentage of inverter penetration and propose methods to enhance stability. Results show that increasing penetration of inverters operated in slave mode, reduces stability. This is observed as oscillations and large settling times for voltage and frequency after disturbances such as islanding with power unbalance and fault-triggered islanding. Results also show that using droops in the inverter control loop can limit oscillations and reduce recovery times even beyond that of a system with large percentage of power generated with a synchronous machine. Finally, it is shown that if the inverter is operated so that its power factor matches that of the local loads, then stability increases.},

A scalable array architecture for 3D imaging is proposed in which single-element phase coherent transceiver (TRX) chips, with programmable TX pulse delay capability, are mounted on a common board to realize the array. This paper presents the design of the enabling TRX chip: a highly integrated 94 GHz phase-coherent pulsed-radar with on-chip antennas. The TRX achieves 10 GHz of frequency tuning range and 300 ps of contiguous pulse position control, enabling its usage in the large-array imager with time-domain TX beamforming. The TRX is capable of transmitting and receiving pulses down to 36 ps, translating to 30 GHz of bandwidth. Interferometric measurements show the TRX can obtain single-target range resolution better than 375 {\$}mu{\$}m (limited by equipment). Based on delay measurements, the time of arrival rms error would be less than 1.3 ps which, if used in a 3D imaging array, leads to less than 0.36 mm of RMS error in voxel size and position.},

abstract = {This paper investigates a digital voltage-mode controller for dc-dc converters based on hysteresis modulation. The control structure implements a high-bandwidth hysteretic differentiator as its main building block, and realizes a nonconventional structure of PID compensation with performances comparable to analog hysteretic controls, thus breaking the bandwidth and dynamic limitations commonly encountered in typical digital control arrangements. The employment of an asynchronous A/D converter based on the threshold inverter quantization concept dramatically shrinks the average delay time that separates the sampling instant from the corrective control action. Moreover, the hysteretic nature of the derivative action results in an inherent nonlinear response to large signal load variations, which translates into fast control intervention and reduced settling times. The hysteretic differentiator employs a ring-oscillator-based modulator, which ensures resolution up to 390 ps without asking for a high-frequency clock. Both the 6-bit asynchronous A/D converter and the ring-oscillator-based modulator are designed and manufactured in the same IC using a standard 0.35 mum CMOS process. Analytical modeling, computer simulations, and experimental results on a synchronous buck converter confirm the validity of the approach and the dynamic performances achievable by the proposed control architecture.},

abstract = {Microinverters operating into the single-phase grid from solar photovoltaic (PV) panels or other low-voltage sources must buffer the twice-line-frequency variations between the energy sourced by the PV panel and that required for the grid. Moreover, in addition to operating over wide average power ranges, they inherently operate over a wide range of voltage conversion ratios as the line voltage traverses a cycle. These factors make the design of microinverters challenging. This paper presents a multilevel energy buffer and voltage modulator (MEB) that significantly reduces the range of voltage conversion ratios that the dc-ac converter portion of the microinverter must operate over by stepping its effective input voltage in pace with the line voltage. The MEB partially replaces the original bulk input capacitor, and functions as an active energy buffer to reduce the total size of the twice-line-frequency energy buffering capacitance. The small additional loss of the MEB can be compensated by the improved efficiency of the dc-ac converter stage, leading to a higher overall system efficiency. The MEB architecture can be implemented in a variety of manners, allowing different design tradeoffs to be made. A prototype microinverter incorporating an MEB, designed for 27 to 38 V dc input voltage, 230-V rms ac output voltage, and rated for a line cycle average power of 70 W, has been built and tested in a grid-connected mode. It is shown that the MEB can successfully enhance the performance of a single-phase grid-interfaced microinverter by increasing its efficiency and reducing the total size of the twice-line-frequency energy buffering capacitance.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a new digital enhanced V{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}-type constant on-time control architecture for solving the ripple oscillation issues when using low-equivalent series resistance (ESR) capacitors in a buck converter. Instead of directly sensing the inductor current, an inductor current ramp estimator with the drift compensation is presented as adding a virtual ESR ripple to the output voltage. Only the input and output voltages are required to be sampled with analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) for estimating the inductor current ramp. Since the sampling rate and resolution requirements of ADCs for voltage sensing are usually less critical with compared to direct current sensing, the proposed digital control architecture is practical for low-cost applications. Besides, the limit-cycle oscillations due to the sampling effects can also be improved by using the estimated current ramp. Furthermore, the small-signal model of the proposed digital enhanced V{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} control architecture is provided to design the estimated current ramp amplitude to stabilize the system and to optimize the system performance. The drift compensation effect is also analyzed in this paper.

abstract = {This paper reviews the current status and implemen- tation of battery chargers, charging power levels, and infrastruc- ture for plug-in electric vehicles and hybrids. Charger systems are categorized into off-board and on-board types with unidirec- tional or bidirectional power flow. Unidirectional charging limits hardware requirements and simplifies interconnection issues.Bidi- rectional charging supports battery energy injection back to the grid. Typical on-board chargers restrict power because of weight, space, and cost constraints. They can be integrated with the elec- tric drive to avoid these problems. The availability of charging infrastructure reduces on-board energy storage requirements and costs. On-board charger systems can be conductive or inductive. An off-board charger can be designed for high charging rates and is less constrained by size and weight. Level 1 (convenience),Level 2 (primary), and Level 3 (fast) power levels are discussed. Future as- pects such as roadbed charging are presented. Various power level chargers and infrastructure configurations are presented, com- pared, and evaluated based on amount of power, charging time and location, cost, equipment, and other factors.},

abstract = {Conventional filter circuits suffer from a number of limitations, including performance degradation due to capacitor parasitic inductance and the size and cost of magnetic elements. Coupled-magnetic filters have been developed that provide increased filter order with a single magnetic component, but also suffer from parasitic inductance in the filter shunt path due to imperfectly-controlled coupling of the magnetics. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to coupled-magnetic filters that overcomes these limitations. Filter sensitivity to variations in coupling is overcome by adaptively tuning the magnetic circuit for minimum rms ripple performance with feedback based on the sensed filter output ripple. This active control enables much greater robustness to manufacturing and environmental variations than is possible in the conventional "zero-ripple" coupled-magnetic approach, while preserving its advantages. Moreover, the proposed technique also adaptively cancels the deleterious effects of capacitor parasitic inductance, thereby providing much higher filter performance than is achievable in conventional designs. The new technique is experimentally demonstrated in a dc-dc power converter application and is shown to provide high performance},

To improve the gain and bandwidth (BW) of the DA, the use of an elevated coplanar waveguide line and also impedance tapering in the synthesized sections are proposed. The effects of elevation and shielding filaments on the impedance, loss, and effective dielectric constant of the transmission line are investigated and accompanied by measurements. A methodology for CMOS DA design is described that can take advantage of the multiple degrees of freedom in terms of device size, topology, and aspect ratio available in these processes. The fabricated tapered cascaded multistage DA achieves a 3-dB BW of 73.5 GHz with a passband gain of 14 dB. This results in a gain-BW product of 370 GHz. The realized 0-dB BW is 83.5 GHz and the input and output matchings stay better than -9 dB up to 77 and 94 GHz, respectively. The chip consumes an area of 1.5 mm times 1.15 mm, while drawing 70 mA from a 1.2-V supply.},

abstract = {A distributed control method is proposed to handle power sharing among a cluster of dc microgrids. The hierarchical control structure of microgrids includes primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. While the load sharing among the sources within a dc microgrid is managed through primary and secondary controllers, a tertiary control level is required to provide the higher-level load sharing among microgrids within a cluster. Power transfer between microgrids enables maximum utilization of renewable sources and suppresses stress and aging of the components, which improves its reliability and availability, reduces the maintenance costs, and expands the overall lifespan of the network. The proposed control mechanism uses a cooperative approach to adjust voltage set points for individual microgrids and, accordingly, navigate the power flow among them. Loading mismatch among neighbor microgrids is used in an updating policy to adjust voltage set point and mitigate such mismatches. While the voltage adjustment policy handles the load sharing among the microgrids within each cluster, at a lower level, each microgrid carries a communication network that is in contact with the secondary control system. It is this lower-level network that propagates voltage set points across all sources within a microgrid. Load sharing and set point propagation are analytically studied for the higher- and lower-level controllers, respectively. Experimental studies on two cluster setups demonstrate excellent controller performance and validate its resiliency against converter failures and communication losses.},

In addition, a resonant gate drive scheme is presented which provides rapid startup and low-loss at HF and VHF frequencies. The converter regulates the output using an on-off control scheme modulating at a fixed frequency. This control method enables fast transient response and efficient light load operation while providing controlled spectral characteristics of the input and output waveforms. An experimental prototype has been built and evaluated. The prototype converter, built with two commercial vertical MOSFETs, operates at a fixed switching frequency of 20 MHz, with an input voltage range of 3.6 V to 7.2 V, an output voltage range of 3 V to 9 V and an output power rating of up to 3 W. The converter achieves higher than 80{\%} efficiency across the entire input voltage range at nominal output voltage, and maintains good efficiency across the whole operating range.},

abstract = {The slew rate of the inductor current is limited by the inductance value and the voltage across the inductor. In a buck converter, when the controller is saturated, the voltage across the inductor during a step-up load transient is {\textless}i{\textgreater}V{\textless}/i{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}in{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}-{\textless}i{\textgreater}V{\textless}/i{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}out{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}, while during a step-down load transient, it is -{\textless}i{\textgreater}V{\textless}/i{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}out{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}. Thus, a buck converter with a large conversion ratio offers asymmetrical step-up and step-down transients. Since the rate of fall of the inductor current is much slower than the rate of rise of the inductor current, the step-down transient lasts longer than the step-up transient for the same change in the load current. The step-down slew rate can be increased by reducing the inductance, but it results in higher inductor current ripple, and hence, higher losses in the power converters. In this paper, we present a novel topology for improving the step-down load transients without reducing the inductance value. The scheme operates only during load transients and restores to the normal operating conditions during steady-state operation. It provides reduced voltage overshoots and faster settling times in output voltage during such transients. The proposed scheme is tested on a 1-V/12-A buck converter switching at 1 MHz, and the experimental results are presented.},

The switching process is illustrated in detail, including the interaction of the low voltage Si MOSFET and the high voltage GaN HEMT in cascode configuration. The switching loss is obtained by solving the equivalent circuits during the switching transition. The analytical results show that the turn-on loss dominates in hard-switching conditions while the turn-off loss is negligible, due to the intrinsic current source driving mechanism. The accuracy of the proposed model is validated by numerous experimental results. The results of both the analytical model and experiments suggest that soft-switching is critical for high voltage GaN in high-frequency high-efficiency applications.},

abstract = {Various applications in digital systems require the involvement of concepts from signal processing and filtering. These specific problems often need the linear dynamic systems to have a transfer function that can specify the behavioural characteristics of the system. When operating in the digital domain, such functions can effectively be used to approximate the same characteristics over the frequency range of importance as any given continuous-time transfer function. In the case with uniform sampling, linear systems theory can directly provide an answer to determine the frequency response. However, when the element of randomness is added to the sample rate of the discrete controller, the common analysis technique of substituting z=ejw will not give the correct result. This paper therefore places an emphasis on the Fourier analysis and highlights a technique to compute the magnitude and phase of a non-uniform rate transfer function at various frequencies in the time domain.},

The comparison reveals a significant difference between Ridley�s model and the proposed model as well as the measured frequency response. If this were true, controller designs relying on Ridley�s model would possibly have to be called into question, presumably affecting many practical designs. For this reason, the model comparison will be repeated here, showing that the results of Ridley�s model are in fact very close to the proposed model of Smithson and Williamson if the correct model formulation is being used.},

abstract = {This paper presents an Optimized Sequence-Based-Control (OSBC) scheme for an isolated multi-stage high-frequency-link (HFL) converter, which directly controls the switching sequences of the power devices without the need for an intermediate pulse-width modulator as in conventional power converter control schemes. OSBC is realized by solving an optimization problem, determining an optimal switching sequence (comprising a union of feasible sequences) and corresponding time horizon for each switching state of the sequence. The proposed model-predictive switching control scheme provides faster transient response compared to the conventional PI control scheme in the ac/ac converter. Another interesting feature of the OSBC is multi-objective control capability through joint-optimization of multiple control goals. In fact, in order to meet various control objectives, a compromise should be made between them so as to achieve the optimized performance and this is even more crucial in capacitor-less topologies (since there is no buffer stage to prevent cross-coupling between various control actions). For the capacitor-less HFL inverter in this paper, joint-optimization of the following control goals are implemented using the OSBC scheme: 1- output voltage regulation, 2- flux balance control (FBC), and 3- loss mitigation. A case study with a sudden change in the input dc voltage characteristics is considered to verify the effectiveness of the joint-optimization of the above control goals in improvement of the HFL inverter operation. The results are verified using simulation for a 4.5 kW, 40 V/208 V three-phase inverter.},

abstract = {The traditional inductor-based buck converter has been the dominant design for step-down switched-mode voltage regulators for decades. Switched-capacitor (SC) DC-DC converters, on the other hand, have traditionally been used in low- power ({\textless};10mW) and low-conversion-ratio ({\textless};4:1) applications where neither regulation nor efficiency is critical. However, a number of SC converter topologies are very effective in their utilization of switches and passive elements, especially in relation to the ever-popular buck converters [1,2,5]. This work encompasses the complete design, fabrication, and test of a CMOS-based switched-capacitor DC-DC converter, addressing the ubiquitous 12 to 1.5V board-mounted point-of-load application. In particular, the circuit developed in this work attains higher efficiency (92{\%} peak, and {\textgreater};80{\%} over a load range of 5mA to 1A) than surveyed competitive buck converters, while requiring less board area and less costly passive components. The topology and controller enable a wide input voltage (V!N) range of 7.5 to 13.5V with an output voltage (Vοu$\tau$) of 1.5V Control techniques based on feedback and feedforward provide tight regulation (30mVpp) under worst-case load-step (1A) conditions. This work shows that SC converters can outperform buck converters, and thus the scope of SC converter applications can and should be expanded.},

abstract = {Electric Vehicles demand high efficiency power converter in their powertrains in order to use the energy of the storage unit in a better way. Specifically, the power converters, that interface the storage unit with the motors, are usually composed of high-losses components. Moreover, the topologies used in these systems present conditions of hard switching and reverse recovery phenomena that reduce the total efficiency in the vehicle. This work analyzes the recovery-less boost converter that can achieve Zero- Current Switching, reverse-recovery reduction and softening of the switching transition. Due to the technique of using two saturable inductors. In addition, the use of next-generation magnetic materials for increasing the efficiency and reducing the reverse recovery current is studied. In this paper, the circuit configuration, the operating principle and the reverse-recovery reduction of the recovery-less converter is reviewed. Moreover, the comparison of ferrites and nanocrystalline soft magnetic materials is presented. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed comparison is validated by experimental tests. As a result, reduction of the peak recovery current and increase of the efficiency are confirmed, achieving a 71{\%} of reduction of the recovery current and 0.25{\%} of efficiency increase at 1kW of output power.},

abstract = {Differential power processing (DPP) is a power electronics system architecture that configures DC-DC converters in parallel with the PV string to improve its power yield. The parallel nature of the DPP architecture brings a number of benefits such as low converter power rating and low power losses, all of which make DPP especially suitable for sub-module level maximum power point tracking (MPPT). Meanwhile, micro-inverters typically perform only module level MPPT and do not address power losses due to uncompensated sub-module mis-match. In this paper, we introduce DPP converters into a micro-inverter system to improve its energy capture by recovering power losses due to sub-module mismatch. We present a small-footprint DPP converter design together with a control scheme such that the DPP converters can work with commercial micro-inverters and can be seamlessly integrated into the existing micro-inverter design. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution, a hardware prototype was built and tested with an off-the-shelf commercial micro-inverter to prove the concept. The improvement in energy capture with DPP converters was experimentally verified. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

Wavelength tuning of the VCSEL structure is enabled by electrostatic deflection of a reflective flexible membrane that is suspended over an air gap and a dielectric mirror, forming a 3$\lambda$ lasing cavity. The lasing gain medium consists of an evaporated organic thin film coated on a reflective membrane, which is then additively placed over a patterned substrate containing the dielectric mirror to fabricate an array of air-gap-VCSEL structures, each 100 $\mu$m in diameter. Beyond the electrostatic actuation of these tunable lasers, the VCSEL array geometry also has the potential to be used as pressure sensors with an all-optical remote excitation and readout and a pressure sensitivity of 64 Pa/nm in the demonstrated configuration.},

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a merged two-stage dc-dc power converter for low-voltage power delivery. By separating the transformation and regulation function of a dc-dc power converter into two stages, both large voltage transformation and high control bandwidth can be achieved. We show how the switched-capacitor stage can operate under soft charging conditions by suitable control and integration (merging) of the two stages. This mode of operation enables improved efficiency and/or power density in the switched-capacitor stage. A 5-to-1 V, 0.8 W integrated dc-dc converter has been developed in 180 nm CMOS. The converter achieves a peak efficiency of 81{\%}, with a regulation stage switching frequency of 10 MHz.},

In this paper, a new modeling technique is presented, which is simple and gives accurate results for both capacitive and resistive loads.

abstract = {Large-scale human genotyping requires technologies with a minimal number of steps, high accuracy, and the ability to automate at a reasonable cost. In this regard, we have developed a rapid, cost-effective readout method for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping that combines an easily automatable single-tube allele-specific primer extension (ASPE) with an efficient high throughput flow cytometric analysis performed on a Luminex 100 flow cytometer. This robust technique employs an ASPE reaction using PCR-derived target DNA containing the SNP and a pair of synthetic complementary capture probes that differ at their 3' end-nucleotide defining the alleles. Each capture probe has been synthesized to contain a unique 25-nucleotide identifying sequence (ZipCode) at its 5' end. An array of fluorescent microspheres, covalently coupled with complementary ZipCode sequences (cZipCodes), was hybridized to biotin-labeled ASPE reaction products, sequestering them for flow cytometric analysis. ASPE offers both an advantage of streamlining the SNP analysis protocol and an ability to perform multiplex SNP analysis on any mixture of allelic variants. All steps of the assay are simple additions of the solutions, incubations, and washes. This technique was used to assay 15 multiplexed SNPs on human chromosome 12 from 96 patients. Comparison of the microsphere-based ASPE assay results to gel-based oligonucleotide ligation assay (OLA) results showed 99.2{\%} agreement in genotype assignments. In addition, the microsphere-based multiplex SNPs assay system was adapted for the identification of bacterial samples by both ASPE and single base chain extension (SBCE) assays. A series of probes designed for different variable sites of bacterial 16S rDNA permitted multiplex analysis and generated species- or genus-specific patterns. Seventeen bacterial species representing a broad range of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria were analyzed within 16 variable sites of 16S rDNA sequence. The results were consistent with the published sequences and confirmed by direct DNA sequencing},

Exploiting oversampling, the controller mimics an analog hysteresis current controller, but it does not employ analog comparators, digital-to-analog converters, or any other analog signal pre- or postprocessing circuitry. Indeed, it fully virtualizes the hysteresis controller's operation and, based only on a nonlinear, efficient current error processing algorithm, drives the power converter at almost constant switching frequency. Overall, it offers the same excellent dynamic performance of the analog hysteresis controller and, at the same time, solves most of the related problems. Because the current error sample processing algorithm is inherently parallel in structure, the controller is suited for VHDL synthesis and field-programmable gate-array implementation, which guarantees flexibility and low cost, together with minimum computation and signal conversion delays. Its intended application areas include active filters, uninterruptible power supplies, microgrid distributed energy resource controllers, laboratory battery testers, and welding machines.},

At the constant-hysteresis controller the operating frequency changes; at the other types continuously or hysteretically arising subharmonic oscillation appears. These phenomena can be analyzed by taking into account the effect of the amplified and fed-back ripple voltage to the operation of the current comparator. Calculations were made to establish maximum usable ac gains for the three basic power converter topologies (buck, boost and buck-boost) and for the above mentioned controllers.

abstract = {We describe a new outphasing energy recovery amplifier (OPERA) which replaces the isolation resistor in the conventional matched combiner with a resistance-compressed rectifier for improved efficiency. The rectifier recovers the power normally wasted in the isolation resistor back to the power supply, while a resistance compression network (RCN) reduces the impedance variation of the rectifier as the output power varies. Because the combiner requires a fixed resistance at the isolation port to ensure matching and isolation between the two outphased power amplifiers (PAs), the RCN serves to maintain high linearity as well as high efficiency in the switching-mode PAs. For demonstration, a prototype OPERA system is designed and implemented with discrete components at an operating frequency of 48 MHz, delivering 20.8 W peak power with 82.9{\%} PAE. The measurement results show an efficiency improvement from 17.9{\%} to 42.0{\%} for a 50-kHz 16-QAM signal with a peak-to-average power ratio of 6.5 dB.},

The switching process is illustrated in detail, including the interaction of the low voltage Si MOSFET and the high voltage GaN HEMT in cascode configuration. The switching loss is obtained by solving the equivalent circuits during the switching transition. The analytical results show that the turn-on loss dominates in hard-switching conditions while the turn-off loss is negligible, due to the intrinsic current source driving mechanism. The accuracy of the proposed model is validated by numerous experimental results. The results of both the analytical model and experiments suggest that soft-switching is critical for high voltage GaN in high-frequency high-efficiency applications.},

abstract = {In 2001, the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center completed an evaluation of the Global Positioning System (GPS) vulnerabilities and the potential impacts to transportation systems in the United States. One of the recommendations of this study was for the operation of backup system(s) to GPS; Loran C, which has been operated by the U.S. Coast Guard for the past 40 years, was identified as one possible backup system. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has been leading a team consisting of members from industry, government, and academia to evaluate the future of Loran-C in the United States. In a recently completed Navigation Transition Study, the FAA concluded that Loran-C, as an independent radionavigation system, is theoretically the best backup for the GPS; however, in order for Loran-C to be considered a viable back-up system to GPS, it must be able to meet the requirements of non-precision approach (NPA) for the aviation community and the Harbor Entrance and Approach (HEA) requirements for the maritime community. The accuracy requirements for Loran to be used as a backup system are 307m for NPA and 20m for HEA. In addition, there are integrity, availability, and continuity requirements. The current Loran system of 24 Stations provides a stated absolute accuracy in navigation position of only 0.25 NM; however, enhanced Loran or eLoran has the capability of meeting the stringent requirements for NPA and HEA. In order to meet the accuracy requirements user receivers must use Additional Secondary Factors (ASFs) in calculating the user position.},

abstract = {In recent years, Si power MOSFET is approaching its performance limits, and Gallium Nitride (GaN) HEMT is getting mature. This paper evaluates the 600 V cascode GaN HEMT performance, and compares it with the state-of-the-art Si CoolMOS in LLC resonant converter. First, the static characterization of 600 V cascode GaN HEMT is described in different temperatures. The switching performance is tested by a double pulse tester to provide the turn-off loss reference to the design of LLC resonant converter. Second, a 400 V-12 V/300 W/1 MHz all-GaN-based converter with the 600 V cascode GaN HEMT is compared with a Si-based converter with the 600 V Si CoolMOS. The device output capacitance is a key factor in the design and loss analysis of LLC resonant converter. The design results show that the total GaN device loss of the all-GaN-based converter can be improved by 42{\%} compared with the total Si device loss. Finally, both 400 V-12 V/300 W/1 MHz Si-based and GaN-based LLC resonant converter prototypes are tested and compared with waveforms and efficiency curves. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

For its wide range of input voltage, it operates in both buck and boost modes. The parameters are properly selected to endure voltage and current stress in all operating ranges. In addition, the electromagnetic interference (EMI) filter is used to reduce the EMI noise and guarantee continuous input current in buck operation. Moreover, the zero-voltage-transient pulse-width-modulation (ZVT-PWM) method is applied to improve the overall efficiency of the converter. The performance of the proposed PFC converter with the widest range of input voltage is evaluated by the hardware experimental test including harmonics analysis based on the International Electrotechnical Commission standard in all operating ranges. Also, the variations of power factor are theoretically analyzed in both buck and boost modes to determine the widest input range of the proposed PFC converter of 2 kW with an EMI filter. These are strongly required to commercialize it in practice. Finally, the efficiency of proposed PFC converter is compared with that of a conventional buck cascaded buck-boost PFC converter under various conditions.},

Large scale unregulated deployment of either technology can have a detrimental impact on the electric grid. However, appropriate pairing of these technologies along with some storage could mitigate their individual negative impacts. This paper presents a framework and an optimization methodology for designing grid-connected systems that integrate plug-in electric vehicle chargers, distributed generation and storage. To demonstrate its usefulness, this methodology is applied to the design of optimal architectures for a residential charging case. It is shown that, given current costs, maximizing grid power usage minimizes system lifecycle cost. However, depending upon the location's solar irradiance patterns, architectures with solar photovoltaic generation can be more cost effective than architectures without. Additionally, Li-ion storage technology and micro wind turbines are not yet cost effective when compared to alternative solutions.},

abstract = {Current control loop response in voltage source inverters impacts the quality of output current and output voltage waveforms. Parabolic current control provides a fast transient response with approximate-constant switching frequency, solving the frequency variation problem of hysteresis current control. This makes it a good candidate for the current control loop of voltage source inverters to achieve a good system performance. Yet, parabolic current control is often implemented with digital-to-analog converters, analog comparators, and field-programmable gate array circuits where increasing switching frequency pushes update speed and bandwidth requirements. Concurrently, even if the transient response of parabolic current control is fast, it can still take up several switching cycles converging to steady state. In order to solve both problems, a new current control strategy, motivated by the convergence analysis of parabolic current control but with a convergence process that takes just one switching operation, is proposed: single-step current control. Since single-step current control samples two data points in a switching cycle instead of using continuous parabolic carriers, it can be easily implemented in a digital microcontroller then high switching frequency can be achieved. The small signal model, dead-time compensation, and stability analysis are also studied in this paper. The convergence speed of the algorithm is verified with experimental hardware prototype and the transient performance of the designed voltage source inverter meets expectation. {\textcopyright} 1986-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {We present a high-efficiency transmitter architecture based on asymmetric multilevel outphasing (AMO), but with a new method of generating discrete amplitude levels from the constituent amplifiers. AMO and multilevel LINC (ML-LINC) transmitters improve their efficiency over LINC by switching the supplies of the power amplifiers (PAs) among a discrete set of voltages. This allows them to minimize the occurrence of large outphasing angles. However, it is also possible to generate a discrete set of amplitudes by varying the duty cycle of the waveform that drives the PAs. The chief advantage of this discrete pulse width modulation (DPWM) is hardware simplicity, as it eliminates the need for a fast, low-loss switching network and a selection of power supply voltages. We demonstrate this concept with a 48-MHz, 20- W peak output power AMO transmitter using a four-level DPWM. At peak output power, the measured power-added efficiency is 77.7{\%}. For a 16-QAM signal with a 6.5-dB peakto- average power ratio, the AMO prototype improves the average efficiency from 17.1{\%} to 36.5{\%} compared to the standard LINC system.},

Two proposed schemes: static synchronous series compensator (SSSC) and controllable series braking resistor (CSBR) have been designed and simulated. The test system simulated represents a wind turbine connected to an electric grid with alternatively employing SSSC and CSBR. The potential of the two schemes is evaluated and analyzed using positive and negative-sequence reference frames in response to balanced and unbalanced fault scenarios. The simulation results using PSCAD/EMTDC demonstrate the performance of the proposed schemes for improving the fault ridethrough capability and transient stability margin in response to severe symmetrical and asymmetrical grid faults. The schemes have shown successful and fast mitigation of voltage disturbance consequences on the mechanical system. The schemes helped the wind turbine to remain connected with considerable isolation from grid faults. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]},

abstract = {The mmWave communication system is operating at a regime with high number of antennas to extend the communication range and to recover the high path loss. Before any communication starts, devices are needed to align their beam pointing angles towards each other. The best beam pointing angles are obtained through BeamForming (BF) training protocol. If the communication environment and devices are stationary, the training results can stay valid for a long period of time. However, the environment is very dynamic. Device movement and human blockage in the link may invalidate the BF training results. Prior work focuses on improving training time when a specific type of errors happens. For example, switching to alternative paths is suggested when human blockage occurs. However, solutions that tackle a type of error are not compatible with others. Therefore, it is important to identify the type of occurring beam errors before applying any remedies. In this paper, we propose a linear dynamical system model to demonstrate the dynamics of the occurring errors due to link blockage and device movement. By using the model, we show that it is hard to estimate the errors purely based on the observable quantity provided. To solve this, we propose two probing protocols that consume very few network resources but are effective in identifying the beam errors as well as correcting them. The simulations show that it effectively handles the beam errors and only consumes 3{\%} of network resources while more than 30{\%} resources are required in the prior work for a fast moving device experiencing occasional link blockage.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a new digital enhanced V 2 -type constant on-time control architecture for solving the ripple oscillation issues when using low-equivalent series resistance (ESR) capacitors in a buck converter. Instead of directly sensing the inductor current, an inductor current ramp estimator with the drift compensation is presented as adding a virtual ESR ripple to the output voltage. Only the input and output voltages are required to be sampled with analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) for estimating the inductor current ramp. Since the sampling rate and resolution requirements of ADCs for voltage sensing are usually less critical with compared to direct current sensing, the proposed digital control architecture is practical for low-cost applications. Besides, the limit-cycle oscillations due to the sampling effects can also be improved by using the estimated current ramp. Furthermore, the small-signal model of the proposed digital enhanced V 2 control architecture is provided to design the estimated current ramp amplitude to stabilize the system and to optimize the system performance. The drift compensation effect is also analyzed in this paper. The effectiveness of the proposed control architecture with the current ramp estimator has been verified with simulation and experimental results by using an FPGA-based hardware platform. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

Outphasing modulation is used to provide the required fine output envelope control. A 4-level supply modulator is implemented that allows for fast and efficient discrete envelope modulation with up to 28-V supply voltages using low-voltage gate drivers and time-alignment logic.

The system structure includes the algorithms for reactive power allocation and online voltage tracking. The effectiveness of the proposed OSVC that improves the network voltage profile is verified by simulation in comparison with the conventional line-drop secondary voltage control and primary voltage control. Since the application relies on the measurement and communication network, the time delay is considered. Based on the available bandwidth of the wide-area measurement systems (WAMSs), the simulation shows the feasibility and success of utilizing the OSVC for real-world implementations. The study also indicates the transient response can be improved further by the proposed solution when high-bandwidth WAMS infrastructures are available in the future. Furthermore, the proposed control strategy is tested in a weak power network with the low-short circuit ratio and failure of communication.},

abstract = {Processes for creating complementary and smooth surfaces by deliberately fracturing a weakened portion of a larger single-crystal silicon structure are described. The structure was designed to refine and concentrate an externally applied load pre-fracture and to provide precision guidance post-fracture. Under the right conditions, material is not ejected from the fracture zone, and the extreme brittleness of crystalline silicon produces complementary fracture surfaces; "closed" post-fracture gaps of 20-30 nm are typical. The effects of lithographic, focused ion beam, and anisotropically etched notches as well as crystal orientation and specimen thickness were studied, and a method was developed for fabricating smooth surfaces perpendicular to the wafer plane: 10 $\mu$m square specimens oriented with the (1 1 0) plane fully notched by anisotropic etching (KOH) and fractured within a structure optimized to apply pure tension during fracture. While developing the fabrication process for a variable capacitor device, it was found that the high temperature processing associated with the thermal oxidation necessary for growing the actuator's dielectric layer blunted the anisotropically etched notches. This blunting manifested itself as material ejecting fractures and occurred even when the notches were covered with a nitride diffusion barrier. The blunting was overcome by employing the actuator's thermal oxide dielectric layer as a mask for etching the notch after all high temperature processing was complete, indicating it was likely due to diffusional smoothing and that high temperature processes may be useful for strengthening anisotropically etched structures. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {—Gallium Nitride high electron mobility transistor (GaN HEMT) has matured dramatically over the last few years. A progressively larger number of GaN devices have been manu- factured for in field applications ranging from low power voltage regulators to high power infrastructure base-stations. Compared to the state of art silicon MOSFET, GaN HEMT has a much bet- ter figure of merit and shows potential for high frequency appli- cations. The first generation of 600V GaN HEMT is intrinsically normally-on device. To easily apply normally-on GaN HEMT in circuit design, a low voltage silicon MOSFET is in series to drive the GaN HEMT, which is well known as cascode structure. This paper studies the characteristics and operation principles of a 600V cascode GaN HEMT. Evaluations of the cascode GaN HEMT performance based on buck converter at hard-switching and soft-switching conditions are presented in detail. Experi- mental results prove that the cascode GaN HEMT is superior to the silicon MOSFET, but it still needs soft-switching in high fre- quency operation due to considerable package and layout para- sitic inductors and capacitors. The cascode GaN HEMT is then applied to a 1MHz 300W 400V/12V LLC converter. A compari- son of experimental results with a state of art silicon MOSFET is provided to validate the advantages of the GaN HEMT.},

abstract = {GaN devices have emerged as a possible replacement for silicon devices in various power conversion applications and as an enabler of new applications not previously possible. This paper presents a 600V Gallium-Nitride (GaN) device based isolated bidirectional DC-DC converter applied in battery energy storage systems. Apart from the features of low turn-off loss, low output capacitance and low drain-source on-state resistance, the most salient one in our bidirectional DC-DC converter application is the ultra-fast freewheeling “body diode” that GaN devices have when compared with Si devices. To distinguish the above mentioned performances of GaN from those of the comparable Si devices, a figure of merit for power devices operating in synchronous rectifying mode is proposed. The converter's operating principle is analyzed in steady state. Switching losses of high voltage and low voltage side switches are simulated based on detailed PSpice models. The converter's safe operation area is extended by using GaN device is explained by calculating the loss in hard switching mode. A thermal simulation is conducted to predict its temperature. Experimental results are presented for a 1 kW, 380-to-12 V prototype DC-DC converter, which demonstrate the validity of the analysis and simulation.},

While much research has been conducted on GaN devices, the discussion of third-quadrant operation is limited. Furthermore, the merits of GaN transistors, particularly their fast switching speed and low on-resistance, make them suitable for switched-capacitor circuits. This paper demonstrates the ability of a GaN transistor to function as a synchronous rectifier in a switched-capacitor circuit. A 500 W GaN-based voltage doubler capable of achieving zero-current switching is presented with supporting experimental results. This circuit achieves peak efficiencies of 97.6{\%} and 96.6{\%} while switching at frequencies of 382 and 893 kHz, respectively.},

During the study, the key characteristics of this novel FITMOS were investigated; a behavioral model was developed in SPICE for simulation and optimization purposes, and their applications in the design of automotive power electronics was explored. In this study, we also identify a previously unrecognized phenomenon in the FITMOS MOSFET. In particular, we show that the on-state resistance of the device depends on both frequency and peak di/dt at a given frequency.

abstract = {This paper investigates an energy-based approach for the prediction of Limit-Cycle Oscillations (LCOs) in digitally controlled dc-dc converters due to quantization effects on the A/D converters and digital pulse-width modulator (DPWM). Existing static and dynamic models predict the existence of only a part of limit cycle oscillations, so that extensive time-domain simulations are usually needed in order to verify the presence of limit-cycle oscillations under different load and input voltage conditions. This paper proposes an alternative approach based on the incremental energy of converter state variables, which is suited for voltage-mode digitally controlled dc-dc converters. By predicting the variation of the incremental energy due to impulse response of the voltage loop, it is possible to establish when the incremental energy becomes small enough to avoid limit-cycle oscillations. This relation, which is expressed as a function of control and converter parameters, represents a necessary condition for the elimination of limit-cycle oscillations. Extensive time-domain simulations have shown that this relation is also close to the effective limit which ensures the absence of LCOs. Simulation and experimental results confirm the validity of the proposed method. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

However, while the supply voltage required for processors and SoCs has scaled down to ∼1V, the voltage range of this popular battery remains ∼2.9V–4.2V (nominally ∼3.6V). To bridge this voltage difference, off-chip power management ICs are typically required. Despite their high efficiency [1], supporting many independent, high-current supplies to e.g. a multi-core SoC is extremely challenging due to cost, area, and supply impedance concerns associated with board and package level parasitics. There is hence strong motivation for efficient, fully integrated voltage regulators (IVRs) that interface directly with the battery while supporting multiple separate on-chip supplies (Fig. 21.6.1a).},

Fundamental limits on utilization of reactive elements developed in the literature for all DC-DC converters are also reviewed and discussed, and this analysis shows that popular SC and inductor-based converters achieve the limits of utilization for reactive components. These limits are stated in terms of the ratio of output power to required stored energy in reactive elements. A detailed analysis of available surface mount discrete components and on-die devices reveals that capacitors have substantially higher energy and power density than their magnetic counterparts. The challenging regulation task for SC converters is also discussed, with a promising strategy outlined.

abstract = {Due to their high relative cost, solar-electric energy systems have yet to be exploited on a widespread basis. It is believed in the energy community that a technology similar to photovoltaics, but offered at about {\$}1/W, would lead to widespread deployment at residential and commercial sites. This paper addresses the feasibility study of a low-cost solar-thermal electricity generation technology, suitable for distributed deployment. Specifically, we discuss a system based on nonimaging solar concentrators, integrated with free-piston Stirling engine devices incorporating integrated electric generation. We target concentrator collector operation at moderate temperatures, in the range of 120 C to 150 C. This temperature range is consistent with the use of optical concentrators with low-concentration ratios, wide angles of radiation acceptance which are compatible with no diurnal tracking and no or only a few seasonal adjustments. Therefore, costs and reliability hazards associated with tracking hardware systems are avoided. This paper further outlines the design, fabrication, and test results of a single-phase free-piston Stirling engine prototype. A very low loss resonant displacer piston is designed for the system using a very linear magnetic spring. The power piston, which is not mechanically linked to the displacer piston, forms a mass-spring resonating subsystem with the gas spring, and has a resonant frequency matched to that of the displacer. The design of heat exchangers is discussed, with an emphasis on their low fluid friction losses. Only standard low-cost materials and manufacturing methods are required to realize such a machine. The fabricated engine prototype is successfully tested as an engine, and the experimental results are presented and discussed. Extensive experimentation on individual component subsystems confirms the theoretical models and design considerations. Based on the experimental results and the verified component models, an appropriately dimensioned Stirling engine candidate is discussed. [DOI: 10.1115/1.4003144]},

A microgrid is a subsystem consisting of small electrical resources, local loads, and power electronic devices. It should be noted that the presence of a CPL as a sink in a microgrid results in nonlinear behavior of the microgrid. CPLs are generally connected to an ac microgrid through a controlled rectifier and/or dc-dc converters. We model an ac microgrid with local RLC load and a CPL with power converter subsystem, which results in a set of nonlinear state-space equations. Then, Popov's absolute stability theorem is utilized to analyze stability conditions for an ac microgrid in the presence of CPL.

@article{Chen2014c,
abstract = {Microinverters operating into the single-phase grid from solar photovoltaic (PV) panels or other low-voltage sources must buffer the twice-line-frequency variations between the energy sourced by the PV panel and that required for the grid. Moreover, in addition to operating over wide average power ranges, they inherently operate over a wide range of voltage conversion ratios as the line voltage traverses a cycle. These factors make the design of microinverters challenging. This paper presents a multilevel energy buffer and voltage modulator (MEB) that significantly reduces the range of voltage conversion ratios that the dc-ac converter portion of the microinverter must operate over by stepping its effective input voltage in pace with the line voltage. The MEB partially replaces the original bulk input capacitor, and functions as an active energy buffer to reduce the total size of the twice-line-frequency energy buffering capacitance. The small additional loss of the MEB can be compensated by the improved efficiency of the dc-ac converter stage, leading to a higher overall system efficiency. The MEB architecture can be implemented in a variety of manners, allowing different design tradeoffs to be made. A prototype microinverter incorporating an MEB, designed for 27 to 38 V dc input voltage, 230-V rms ac output voltage, and rated for a line cycle average power of 70 W, has been built and tested in a grid-connected mode. It is shown that the MEB can successfully enhance the performance of a single-phase grid-interfaced microinverter by increasing its efficiency and reducing the total size of the twice-line-frequency energy buffering capacitance.},

Thus, the examination of the influence of ageing depended physiological and mental variances of potential user groups is an important part of biometric research. In this paper a survey of studies is presented which examining effects of biological aging on enrollment and authentication performance as well as usability of biometric systems based on modalities fingerprint, face and iris. In order to compare the findings of the studies and overcome the problem, that nearly every one of these studies uses its own database with varying number of users and different sensors, measurements and/or aging levels, we developed a novel graphical representation of the results. It provides an overview of changes appearing with increasing age and possible influences on performance or usability. The outcomes of a high number of evaluations are compared for each of the three biometric modalities in context of aging and finally concluded in the novel graphical representation.},

A three-phase converter is configured to inject a broadband perturbation on top of its nominal output current to enable online identification of grid impedance. The ratio of converter and grid impedance is computed in real-Time by utilizing the measured grid impedance and the analytical impedance model of the inverter. A Nyquist contour is plotted based on the impedance ratio. The contour can be used to assess impedance-based stability margin and to allow, e.g., adaptive tuning, more efficient post-fault diagnostics or to enable re-selection of control parameters. The method is implemented on a dSPACE real-Time control platform and the associated Control Desk software. The paper also discusses potential limitations and suggests future improvements.

abstract = {This paper presents a merged-two-stage circuit topology suitable for either wide-range dc input voltage or ac line voltage at low-to-moderate power levels (e.g., up to 30 W). This two-stage topology is based on a soft-charged switched-capacitor preregulator/transformation stage and a high-frequency magnetic regulator stage. Soft charging of the switched capacitor circuit, zero voltage switching of the high-frequency regulator circuit, and time-based indirect current control are used to maintain high efficiency, high power density, and high power factor. The proposed architecture is applied to an LED driver circuit, and two implementations are demonstrated: a wide input voltage range dc-dc converter and a line interfaced ac-dc converter. The dc-dc converter shows 88{\%}-96{\%} efficiency at 30-W power across 25-200-V input voltage range, and the ac-dc converter achieves 88{\%} efficiency with 0.93 power factor at 8.4-W average power. Contributions of this paper include: 1) demonstrating the value of a merged two-stage architecture to provide substantial design benefits in high-input voltage, low-power step down conversion applications, including both wide-range-input dc-dc and line-input ac-dc systems; 2) introduction of a multimode soft-charged SC stage for the merged architecture that enables compression of an 8:1 input voltage range into a 2:1 intermediate range, along with its implementation, loss considerations, and driving methods; and 3) merging of this topology with an resonant transition discontinuous-mode inverted buck stage and pseudocurrent control to enable step-down power conversion (e.g., for LED lighting) operating at greatly increased frequencies and reduced magnetics size than with more conventional approaches.},

The four channels on the device provide independent spectral analysis from DC to 1 kHz, with variable bandwidth and power filtering characteristics. The noise floor and flexible spectral processing support a broad range of potential applications including sleep staging, Parkinson's disease, detection of movement intention for neuroprosthesis, and detection of high frequency ldquofast ripplesrdquo for exploring seizure prediction.

These specific problems often need the linear dynamic systems to have a transfer function that can specify the behavioural characteristics of the system. When operating in the digital domain, such functions can effectively be used to approximate the same characteristics over the frequency range of importance as any given continuous-time transfer function. In the case with uniform sampling, linear systems theory can directly provide an answer to determine the frequency response. However, when the element of randomness is added to the sample rate of the discrete controller, the common analysis technique of substituting z=e{\textless}sup{\textgreater}jw{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} will not give the correct result. This paper therefore places an emphasis on the Fourier analysis and highlights a technique to compute the magnitude and phase of a non-uniform rate transfer function at various frequencies in the time domain.},

These networks, which we term resistance compression networks, serve to substantially decrease the variation in effective resistance seen by a tuned RF inverter as loading conditions change. We explore the operation, performance characteristics, and design of these networks, and present experimental results demonstrating their performance. Their combination with rectifiers to form RF-to-dc converters having narrow-range resistive input characteristics is also treated.

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel variable sampling period filter phase-locked loop (VSPF-PLL) for use in the general area of three-phase systems. It is based on the concept of variable sampling period, which allows to automatically adjust the sampling frequency to be {\textless}i{\textgreater}N{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}PLL{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} times the line frequency. Conventional three-phase PLL are based on synchronous reference frames (SRFs) to estimate the phase error between the PLL and the input signals. However, SRF transform fail when the voltage waveforms are distorted. In this paper, a sliding-Goertzel-transform- based filter is used in the loop to reject disturbances, such as unbalanced voltage and harmonics. It allows to detect the positive sequence present in the systems without errors. Characteristics of VSPF-PLL, including its mathematical model as well as steady state and dynamic responses, are discussed in this paper. The method is implemented in a DSP and tested using typical disturbances, such as frequency steps, unbalances, harmonics, saturation, and line-to-ground fault. Comparative simulations are performed between the proposed VSPF-PLL and some of the most common three-phase PLL described in the literature. Advantages of the proposed system over the methods analyzed are also discussed. Structural simplicity, robustness, and harmonics rejection are other attractive features offered by the proposed system.},

abstract = {Photovoltaic (PV) stations have been built widely in the world to utilize solar energy directly. In order to reduce the capital and operational costs, early fault diagnosis is playing an increasingly important role by enabling the long effective operation of PV arrays. This paper analyzes the terminal characteristics of faulty PV strings and arrays, and develops a PV array fault diagnosis technique. The terminal current-voltage curve of a faulty PV array is divided into two sections: a high-voltage and a low-voltage fault diagnosis section. The corresponding working points of healthy string modules, healthy and faulty modules in an unhealthy string are then analyzed for each section. By probing into different working points, a faulty PV module can be located. The fault information is of critical importance for the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and the array dynamical reconfiguration. Furthermore, the string current sensors can be eliminated while the number of voltage sensors can also be reduced by optimizing voltage sensor locations. Typical fault scenarios including mono-string, multi-string and partial shadow for a 1.6 kW 3×3 PV array are presented and experimentally tested to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed fault diagnosis method.},

abstract = {The cascode structure is widely used for high voltage normally-on wide-band-gap devices. However, the interaction between the high voltage normally-on device and the low voltage normally-off Si MOSFET may induce undesired features. This paper analyzes the voltage distribution principle during the turn-off transition as well as the zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) principle during the turn-on transition for cascode devices. The capacitance mismatch between high voltage normally-on devices and the low voltage Si MOSFET causes the Si MOSFET to avalanche, and internal high voltage devices lose the ZVS condition. This issue must be solved in consideration of both power loss and reliability. A simple and effective solution is proposed by adding an extra capacitor to compensate the capacitance mismatch, thereby avoiding Si MOSFET avalanche and achieving true ZVS for cascode devices. The benefits and small penalty of this solution are analyzed in detail. The theoretical analysis is validated by experiments which are implemented based on a 600V cascode GaN device. The experiment shows that the proposed method improves the 600V cascode GaN devices performance significantly in high frequency applications.},

abstract = {Resonant rectifiers have important applications in very-high-frequency (VHF) power conversion systems, including dc–dc converters, wireless power transfer systems, and energy recovery circuits for radio-frequency systems. In many of these applications, it is desirable for the rectifier to appear as a resistor at its ac input port. However, for a given dc output voltage, the input impedance of a resonant rectifier varies in magnitude and phase as output power changes. This paper presents a design methodology for class E rectifiers that maintain near-resistive input impedance along with the experimental demonstration of this approach. Resonant rectifiers operating at 30 MHz over 10:1 and 2:1 power ranges are used to validate the design methodology and identify its limits. Furthermore, a number of Si Schottky diodes are experimentally evaluated for VHF rectification and categorized based on performance.},

abstract = {Conventional filter circuits suffer from a number of limitations, including performance degradation due to capacitor parasitic inductance and the size and cost of magnetic elements. Coupled-magnetic filters have been developed that provide increased filter order with a single magnetic component, but also suffer from parasitic inductance in the filter shunt path due to imperfectly-controlled coupling of the magnetics. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to coupled-magnetic filters that overcomes these limitations. Filter sensitivity to variations in coupling is overcome by adaptively tuning the magnetic circuit for minimum rms ripple performance with feedback based on the sensed filter output ripple. This active control enables much greater robustness to manufacturing and environmental variations than is possible in the conventional "zero-ripple" coupled-magnetic approach, while preserving its advantages. Moreover, the proposed technique also adaptively cancels the deleterious effects of capacitor parasitic inductance, thereby providing much higher filter performance than is achievable in conventional designs. The new technique is experimentally demonstrated in a dc-dc power converter application and is shown to provide high performance},

abstract = {Analysis, design, fabrication, and experimental assessment of a symmetric three-phase free-piston Stirling engine system is discussed in this paper. The system is designed to operate with moderate-temperature heat input that is consistent with solar-thermal collectors. Diaphragm pistons and nylon flexures are considered for this prototype to eliminate surface friction and to provide appropriate seals. In addition, low loss diaphragm pistons, etched and woven-wire screen heat exchangers, and plastic flexures, as the main components of the system, are outlined. The experimental results are presented and compared with design analysis. Experiments successfully confirm the design models for heat exchanger flow friction losses and gas spring hysteresis dissipation. Furthermore, it is revealed that gas spring hysteresis loss is an important dissipation phenomenon for low-power Stirling engines and should be carefully addressed in design. Analysis shows that the gas hysteresis dissipation is reduced drastically by increasing the number of phases in a multiphase Stirling engine system. It is further shown that for an even number of phases, half of the engine chambers could be eliminated by utilizing a reversing mechanism within the multiphase system. The mathematical formulation and modal analysis of multiphase Stirling engine system are then extended to a system that incorporates a reverser. By introducing a reverser to the fabricated prototype, the system successfully operates in engine mode. The system proves its self-starting capability and validates the computed start-up temperature.},

abstract = {This paper presents the design principles for highly efficient legged robots, the implementation of the principles in the design of the MIT Cheetah, and the analysis of the high-speed trotting experimental results. The design principles were derived by analyzing three major energy-loss mechanisms in locomotion: heat losses from the actuators, friction losses in transmission, and the interaction losses caused by the interface between the system and the environment. Four design principles that minimize these losses are discussed: employment of high torque-density motors, energy regenerative electronic system, low loss transmission, and a low leg inertia. These principles were implemented in the design of the MIT Cheetah; the major design features are large gap diameter motors, regenerative electric motor drivers, single-stage low gear transmission, dual coaxial motors with composite legs, and the differential actuated spine. The experimental results of fast trotting are presented; the 33-kg robot runs at 22 km/h (6 m/s). The total power consumption from the battery pack was 973 W and resulted in a total cost of transport of 0.5, which rivals running animals' at the same scale. 76{\%} of the total energy consumption is attributed to heat loss from the motor, and the remaining 24{\%} is used in mechanical work, which is dissipated as interaction loss as well as friction losses at the joint and transmission.},

In an I-PV system, the inverters in a PV plant are reconfigured in such a way that two or more distribution networks/feeders are interconnected. The I-PV system is operated as a flexible ac transmission system (FACTS) device to regulate the point-of-common coupling voltage on either feeder. One of the key features of the I-PV system is that real power can be exchanged between two feeders via the PV plant inverters. A {\$}{\{}rm P{\}}{\$}-{\$}{\{}rm Q{\}}{\$}-{\$}{\{}rm V{\}}{\$} droop control method is thus proposed, especially for systems with low {\$}{\{}rm X{\}}/{\{}rm R{\}}{\$} ratio, to facilitate simultaneous active and reactive power control to regulate the point of common coupling voltage.

abstract = {This paper presents a digital hybrid ripple-based constant on-time control scheme for voltage regulator modules (VRMs). Due to the sampling effects of the digital implementation, the stability issue becomes worse than the analog ripple-based control schemes, especially when low-ESR decoupling capacitors are used as the output filter. In order to stabilize the system and to fulfill the output impedance requirement of adaptive voltage positioning (AVP), a hybrid ramp compensation strategy, which includes the external ramp and the estimated current ramp, is proposed. The small-signal model of the proposed architecture is derived to provide the design guideline for the ramp compensation gains and the number of output and decoupling capacitors. Besides, only low sampling-rate Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) are required to sample the input voltage, the output voltage, and the average current making the proposed architecture compatible with the cost/complexity constraints of VRM applications. Simulation and experimental results show that the ripple-based control can achieve high-bandwidth performance, and the proposed digital control architecture can fulfill the AVP design requirements of single-phase VRMs.},

abstract = {DC-DC converters for large conversion ratio appli- cations face challenges such as high device stress and large induc- tor size. Switched-capacitor (SC) converters are known to have reduced device stress and no inductors, but the associated large transient current and poor efficiency at regulated output have prevented their wide adoptions. In this work, a complete solution is proposed, including the control and design considerations for a magnetic hybrid type of SC converter, so that the capacitor charging loss is eliminated and high efficiency is maintained with voltage regulation. Compared to conventional buck converters, the proposed converter offers the advantages of higher efficiency and significantly reduced inductor size. A 170 V to 24 V, 70 W prototype with a wide input and output voltage operating range is implemented using GaN transistors. A low profile heat- sink is designed and built by 3D printing to sufficiently cool the converter. A peak efficiency of 97{\%} and a power density of 276 W/in3 are achieved, which compare favorably to both conventional SC converters and buck converters},

Due to the high supply frequency, such applications are particularly demanding for both power and control devices, requiring control capabilities even for frequencies up to several kHz. Furthermore variable supply frequency leads to variable frequency harmonics in the aircraft grid that are challenging to track and compensate. An original and effective solution based on an iterative learning control approach, where both the number of samples per period and the sampling frequency are changed, is studied and implemented. Experimental results confirm the validity of the proposed solution.},

The correlation between the loading (insertion) impedance and the geometrical and physical characteristics of the probe is clearly described through formulas that are useful for design purposes. The model is compared with those existing in the technical literature, and the main differences are highlighted and discussed. The theoretical predictions are experimentally confirmed. A direct application of the concepts discussed here to the improvement of the accuracy of the V/I-type vector impedance measurements is also shown.

But the unpredicted limit cycle due to the nonlinearity of ADC and DPWM is one of major issues in this architecture.

Large signal averaged circuit model is built, and small signal model can be derived from it. In this model, the active switch is modeled by a current source, the diode is modeled by a voltage source and the inductor is modeled by a current source. The proposed modeling method is also convenient to be applied to various DC-DC topologies. The Pspice simulation was used to verify the proposed model.

The four candidate topologies are: the salient-and non-salient-pole wound-field synchronous alternators, the Lundell alternator, and the homopolar inductor alternator. The analysis is made with the alternator utilizing a switched-mode rectifier that enables load matching for optimal power transmission. This paper models and compares the alternators using hand calculations. Lumped parameter models of each of the four alternators are derived. The output power and efficiency of each machine is evaluated when utilized with a switched-mode boost rectifier and operating at the load matched condition. A direct mathematical comparison of the sizing equations for the four classes of machines is offered. Based on the analysis, the Lundell alternator has the highest power output and efficiency when compared at the same dimensions and field ampere turns excitation. Part II will cover a more detailed and accurate cost optimization of the four alternators while subject to the constraints and requirements of future automobiles.},

abstract = {This paper presents a digital hybrid ripple-based constant on-time control scheme for voltage regulator modules (VRMs). Due to the sampling effects of the digital implementation, the stability issue becomes worse than the analog ripple-based control schemes, especially when low-ESR decoupling capacitors are used as the output filter. In order to stabilize the system and to fulfill the output impedance requirement of adaptive voltage positioning (AVP), a hybrid ramp compensation strategy, which includes the external ramp and the estimated current ramp, is proposed. The small-signal model of the proposed architecture is derived to provide the design guideline for the ramp compensation gains and the number of output and decoupling capacitors. Besides, only low sampling-rate Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) are required to sample the input voltage, the output voltage, and the average current making the proposed architecture compatible with the cost/complexity constraints of VRM applications. Simulation and experimental results show that the ripple-based control can achieve high-bandwidth performance, and the proposed digital control architecture can fulfill the AVP design requirements of single-phase VRMs.},

abstract = {Fast power converters are desired in microprocessors, audio, and servomotor power supplies. Fixed-topology dc-dc converters have a minimum time in which to respond to line, load, and control change. This response depends on converter control, topology, and circuit parameters. Minimum-time control (MTC) considers these three items when it predicts postdisturbance steady-state points and directs capacitor voltage and inductor current in the shortest time. In this paper a nonlinear model-predictive control steers energy using geometrical curved control surfaces derived from piecewise linear (PWL) and bilinear models. The MTC differs from previous work on the topic in that it considers lossy components (a cause for nontriangular ripple) and is an open-form solution (as originally proposed by LaSalle in 1959). The different approach revealed a quantitative link between the needed control surface memory and state/parameter resolution. Results are generalized for two-state dc-dc converters and all parameter/control disturbances. An unconventional digital method was devised to accommodate the open-form solutions. It involved a priori control surface calculations, A/D scaling, surface quantizing, and image compression. The final control executed no real-time arithmetic operations. MTC performance was compared with other pulsewidth modulation controls and time-optimal control in simulations, and tests were performed in hardware using synchronous buck and boost converters.},

We investigated the effects that influencing factors such as the number of zones and inhabitants, randomness of occupancy patterns and thermal mass of the residence can have on the efficacy of occupancy-moderated zonal space-conditioning (OZS) under different scenarios. Simulations driven by real data and highly realistic proxy data reveal that OZS can achieve improvements averaging 23{\%} over the case without under certain settings. Our investigations also revealed that a house with heavier thermal mass stands to gain as much as 15{\%} from OZS with pre-conditioning than a lighter one. We further offer a few pointers on reducing the cost of space-conditioning using OZS under a demand-driven pricing scheme to the average homeowner based on our findings.?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

While techniques for transmitting power using spread spectrum modulation already exist, this paper introduces differ- ent receiver topologies and algorithms for receiving power spread across a wideband of frequencies. The power output and the efficiency of receivers is constrained by the switch parameters. Receiver topology choice depends on the application requirements and constraints. The receiver realization provides a platform for the evolution of direct-sequence spread-spectrum wireless power transfer},

abstract = {The present paper deals with the two-dimensional numerical simulation of gaseous flow and heat transfer in planar microchannel and nanochannel with different wall temperatures in transitional regime 0.1Kn1 . An atomistic molecular simulation method is used known as thermal lattice-Boltzmann method. The results of simulation are presented in four cases corresponding to the Fourier flow, shear-driven flow (Couette flow), pressure-driven flow (Poiseuille flow), and mixed shear-pressure-driven flow in the developing and fully developed regions. The mixed shear-pressure-driven flow is divided into two subcases with shear stress and pressure gradient acting in the same and the opposite directions. Normalized temperature and velocity profiles across the channel, distribution of local wall Nusselt number, and friction coefficient are illustrated. Using this method, nonlinear pressure distribution in the streamwise direction, reduction in mass flow rate, C(f)Re, and Nu by increasing the Knudsen number are studied. It is seen that for Couette flow, Nu over the hotter plate is greater than the cooler plate, but for the pressure-driven flow with stationary wall temperature dependency of viscosity and thermal conductivity causes this trend to be reversed. The reversed flow appearance in the velocity profile is captured in the case of opposite shear-pressure-driven flow.},

abstract = {Photovoltaic energy offers great benefits over conventional energy resources, but its large scale deployment has long been hindered by the prohibitive cost and low energy output. Advanced power electronics design plays a critical role in reducing the cost of PV energy systems and improving the power output. Conventional distributed power electronics solutions in a PV system such as DC optimizer and micro-inverters have been developed, but still they still have certain limitations in terms of cost and efficiency. This thesis proposes the use of a technique known as differential power processing (DPP) to achieve substantial efficiency improvement and cost reduction over the conventional solutions and develops hardware and control design to apply the DPP technique to a PV system. This thesis introduces the fundamental principle of differential power processing and highlights its advantages over the conventional solutions. Several hardware designs of the DPP converter are presented, and several prototypes have been built and tested. These hardware prototypes achieve high conversion efficiency and very small volume to the point that they can be easily fit into a PV module junction box (commonly referred to as PV module integration). Moreover, a distributed algorithm for controlling DPP converters in a PV system is developed. This algorithm achieves true maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of series-connected PV sub-modules by relying only on local voltage measurements and neighbor-to-neighbor communication between the DPP converters. Compared to previous solutions, the proposed algorithm achieves a reduced number of perturbations at each step and potentially faster tracking without adding extra hardware; all these features make this algorithm well-suited for long sub-module strings. An indoor experimental setup was established and various experiments prove the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Finally, the DPP technique is applied to a micro-inverter system. Micro-inverters typically perform only module level MPPT and do not address power losses due to uncompensated sub-module mismatch. The thesis provides a solution to seamlessly integrate DPP converters into the existing micro-inverter system to improve its energy capture by recovering power losses due to sub-module mismatch. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution, a hardware prototype was built and tested with an off-the-shelf commercial micro-inverter to prove the concept. The improvement in energy capture with DPP converters is experimentally verified.},

abstract = {This paper reports the demonstration of the resonant inverter circuit for electrodeless fluorescent lamps using a high-voltage GaN-HEMT as a main switching device. A 620-V/1.4-A GaN-HEMT was designed and fabricated for power electronic applications. The dynamic on-resistance increased with current collapse phenomena was suppressed by the dual-FP structure and the switching operation could be realized under high applied voltage of over 350 V. As a high-voltage and high-frequency power supply application, a 13.56-MHz resonant inverter circuit for electrodeless fluorescent lamps was demonstrated using the fabricated device. The demonstrated circuit achieved high-voltage operation of 380 V, high-speed gate-switching of 4.5-7 ns, and lighting of the electrodeless lamp with an input power of 7-10 W. High-voltage operation realized a simple circuit composition for high-power efficiency and the discharge ignition of the lamp without the starting circuit. The power efficiency of the inverter circuit was over 90{\%} with an input power of 9 W. These results show that high-voltage GaN devices are suitable for high-frequency switching applications under high-input voltages of several hundred volts.},

This technique uses additional passive components to inject a compensation current that cancels the parasitic current, thereby improving high-frequency filtering performance. Two implementation approaches for this technique are introduced. The first implementation achieves cancellation using an additional small winding on the filter inductor and a small capacitor. This approach is effective where very high coupling of the windings can be achieved or where only moderate performance improvements are required. The second implementation utilizes a small radio frequency transformer in parallel with the filter inductor to inject cancellation currents from the compensation capacitor. This technique requires an additional component (the transformer), but can provide a high degree of cancellation. Experimental results confirm the theory in both implementations.},

In many of these applications, it is desirable for the rectifier to appear as a resistor at its ac input port. However, for a given dc output voltage, the input impedance of a resonant rectifier varies in magnitude and phase as output power changes. A design method is introduced for realizing single-diode “shunt-loaded” resonant rectifiers, or class E rectifiers, that provide near-resistive input impedance over a wide range of output power levels.

abstract = {IEEE In order to increase the efficiency of modern microprocessors power supplies used in data centers and networking applications, the 48V dc distribution bus has been recently adopted. Currently, voltage regulation modules (VRMs) are accomplished using two-stage conversion systems, in which an inter- mediate 12 V dc bus is utilized. This paper presents an innovative single-stage approach for the 48 V VRM based on a quasi-resonant constant on-time (COT) operation. The proposed topology inherently integrates the multi-phase approach, providing fast phase shedding and flat high efficiency curves even at light load condition. This is a unique advantage, which is not usually available in the two-stage approach, that is very important in server architectures, where high efficiency is required even at light load condition. Moreover, the proposed solution offers fast transient response and easy current sharing capabilities. The digital controller has been implemented in 0.16  {\&} {\#}x03BC;m lithography together with a DPWM with a 195 ps resolution, and a 40 MS/s, 7-bit ADC. Experimental results show an efficiency of 93.1{\%} for a 250 A, 1.8 V VRM and of 93.2{\%} for a 102 A, 1.2 V DDR power supply.},

abstract = {A boundary control scheme for boost converters with enhanced performance using the natural switching surface (NSS) is presented in this paper. The derivation of the Switching Surface (SS) is performed in the normalized domain to obtain a general geometrical representation that is applicable to any combination of boost converter parameters. The resulting SS provides an excellent dynamic response during start-up and sudden load changes, achieving steady state in only one switching action. In order to illustrate the characteristic features and the superior performance of the natural SS, a geometrical analysis is fully developed and compared to other recent SSs. A design example is presented to illustrate the benefits of the normalization technique, and the qualities of the natural SS are confirmed with experimental results of a 30 W, 10 V/22 V converter.},

Proc. 615, 1261 (2002); 10.1063/1.1472940 Integrated optical interferometric detection method for micromachined capacitive acoustic transducers A radio frequency (RF)/ultrasound hybrid imaging system using airborne capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers (CMUTs) is proposed for the remote detection of embedded objects in highly dispersive media (e.g., water, soil, and tissue). RF excitation provides permittivity contrast, and ultra-sensitive airborne-ultrasound detection measures thermoacoustic-generated acoustic waves that initi-ate at the boundaries of the embedded target, go through the medium-air interface, and finally reach the transducer.

[http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4909508] Non-contact and remote detection of embedded or hid-den objects in highly dispersive and opaque packaging, with-out the use of ionizing radiation, is one of the holy grails in remote sensing. This could have important applications in medical imaging, security screening, and non-destructive test-ing. Traditional radio frequency (RF), microwave, and optical techniques provide degraded detection capabilities in highly dispersive and lossy media. Dispersion and multi scattering decorrelate the signals from scatters, and there is a trade-off between penetration depth and resolution. X-ray methods use ionizing radiation and are therefore not safe for a variety of applications, and also could not be used for detection and identification of soft materials. Acoustic and mechanical methods require contact with the object, and often lack the contrast required to do sufficient material identification. Two-way losses in purely acoustic detection degrade signal levels too much, which makes it impractical for detection. In this work, we present a hybrid method based on the thermoacous-tic (TA) effect and combine microwave excitation with non-contact airborne ultrasound detection to provide a robust so-lution to this long-standing challenge (Fig. 1). A detection system, as the first step toward an imaging system, is designed with (1) pulsed microwave excitation that generates absorption contrast based on dielectric properties of the em-bedded sample, (2) the thermoacoustic effect that generates ultrasonic waves due to minute local expansions, and (3) high sensitivity acoustic detection that could detect a minimum acoustic pressure of 240 lPa (rms) (corresponding to dis-placements down to 1.3 pm) at the transducer surface. In microwave-induced TA imaging, tissue absorbs a portion of the electromagnetic energy based on dielectric properties and produces an ultrasonic wave that is then detected and used to reconstruct the image. The generation of the TA signal follows: 1–3},
